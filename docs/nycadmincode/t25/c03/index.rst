Section 25-301 ::    
        
     
        §  25-301  Purpose  and  declaration  of public policy. a. The council
      finds that many improvements, as herein defined, and landscape features,
      as herein defined, having a special character or a special historical or
      aesthetic interest or  value  and  many  improvements  representing  the
      finest  architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the
      city, have been uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of  preserving
      and  continuing the use of such improvements and landscape features, and
      without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to  the  people
      of  the  city of the aesthetic, cultural and historic values represented
      by such improvements and landscape features. In addition, distinct areas
      may be similarly uprooted or may have their  distinctiveness  destroyed,
      although the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It
      is  the  sense  of the council that the standing of this city as a world
      wide  tourist  center  and  world  capital  of  business,  culture   and
      government   cannot  be  maintained  or  enhanced  by  disregarding  the
      historical and architectural heritage of the city and  by  countenancing
      the destruction of such cultural assets.
        b.  It  is  hereby  declared  as  a  matter  of public policy that the
      protection,  enhancement,  perpetuation  and  use  of  improvements  and
      landscape  features  of  special  character  or  special  historical  or
      aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the
      interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare  of  the  people.
      The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  (a)  effect  and accomplish the
      protection,  enhancement  and  perpetuation  of  such  improvements  and
      landscape  features and of districts which represent or reflect elements
      of the city's cultural, social, economic,  political  and  architectural
      history;  (b)  safeguard  the  city's  historic,  aesthetic and cultural
      heritage, as embodied and  reflected  in  such  improvements,  landscape
      features  and  districts;  (c)  stabilize and improve property values in
      such  districts;  (d)  foster  civic  pride  in  the  beauty  and  noble
      accomplishments  of  the  past;  (e)  protect  and  enhance  the  city's
      attractions to tourists and visitors and the  support  and  stimulus  to
      business  and  industry  thereby provided; (f) strengthen the economy of
      the city; and (g) promote the  use  of  historic  districts,  landmarks,
      interior  landmarks and scenic landmarks for the education, pleasure and
      welfare of the people of the city.

        (a) The commission may make a determination that the valuation of  the
      improvement  parcel  is an amount different from such assessed valuation

      next  preceding  the effective date of the current assessed valuation in
      effect at the time of the filing of such request; and
        (b) The commission may make a determination  that  the  value  of  the

      improvement parcel, with consideration given, where the  improvement  is
      subject  to  residential  rent  control,  to  the  total  amount of rent
      adjustments previously granted, exclusive of rent adjustments because of
      changes  in  dwelling  space,  services,  furniture,   furnishings,   or
      equipment, major capital improvements, or substantial rehabilitation;
        (4) The presence of deferred amortization in purchase money mortgages,
      or the assignment of such mortgages at a discount;
    
        (5)  Any other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which, in
      the judgment of the commission, may have a bearing upon the question  of
      financing.
        (3) For the purposes of this subdivision v:
        (a)  Net  annual return shall be the amount by which the earned income
      yielded by the  improvement  parcel  during  a  test  year  exceeds  the
      operating  expenses  of such parcel during such year, excluding mortgage
      interest and amortization, and excluding allowances for obsolescence and
      reserves, but including an allowance for depreciation of two per  centum
      of  the assessed value of the improvement, exclusive of the land, or the
      amount shown for depreciation of the improvement in the latest  required
      federal  income  tax return, whichever is lower; provided, however, that
      no allowance for depreciation of the improvement shall be included where
      the improvement has  been  fully  depreciated  for  federal  income  tax
      purposes or on the books of the owner; and
        (b)  Test year shall be (1) the most recent full calendar year, or (2)
      the owner's most recent fiscal  year,  or  (3)  any  twelve  consecutive
      months  ending  not more than ninety days prior to the filing (a) of the
      request for a certificate, or (b) of an application for a renewal of tax
      benefits pursuant to the provisions of section 25-309 of  this  chapter,
      as the case may be.
        w.  "Scenic landmark." Any landscape feature or aggregate of landscape
      features, any part of which is thirty years old or older, which  has  or

      of  the  city,  state  or  nation and which has been designated a scenic

      projected public improvements and any plans for the development, growth,
      improvement   or  renewal  of  the  area  involved.  The  city  planning
      commission shall include with any such  report  its  recommendation,  if
    
      any,  for  council  action  with  respect  to  any such designation of a
      historic district.
        (2)  The  council  may  modify  or  disapprove  by  majority  vote any
      designation of the commission or amendment thereof  within  one  hundred
      twenty days after a copy thereof is filed with the council provided that
      the  city  planning commission has submitted the report required by this
      subdivision or that sixty days have elapsed  since  the  filing  of  the
      designation  or  amendment  with  the  council. All votes of the council
      pursuant to this subdivision shall be filed  by  the  council  with  the
      mayor  and  shall  be  final unless disapproved by the mayor within five
      days of such filing. Any such disapproval by the mayor shall be filed by
      the mayor with the council  and  shall  be  subject  to  override  by  a
      two-thirds  vote  of  the council within ten days of such filing. If the
      council shall disapprove such designation or amendment, such designation
      or amendment shall continue in full force and effect until the time  for
      disapproval  by  the  mayor  has expired; provided, however, that if the
      mayor disapproves such council disapproval, it shall  continue  in  full
      force  and  effect unless the council overrides the mayor's disapproval.
      If  the  council  shall  modify  such  designation  or  amendment,  such
      designation  or amendment as adopted by the commission shall continue in
      full force and effect until the time for disapproval by  the  mayor  has
      expired,  and  after  such  time  such  modification shall be in effect;
      provided,  however,  that  if  the  mayor   disapproves   such   council
      modification,  the designation or amendment as adopted by the commission
      shall continue in full force and effect unless the council overrides the
      mayor's disapproval, and in the event of override the modification shall
      take effect on and after the date of such override.
        h. (1) The commission shall have power, after  a  public  hearing,  to
      adopt  a  resolution  proposing  rescission, in whole or in part, of any
      designation or  amendment  or  modification  thereof  mentioned  in  the
      preceding  subdivisions  of this section. Within ten days after adopting
      any such resolution, the commission shall file a copy thereof  with  the
      council and the city planning commission.
        (2)  Within sixty days after such filing, the city planning commission
      shall submit to the council a report with respect  to  the  relation  of
      such  proposed rescission of any such designation, whether of a historic
      district or a landmark, interior landmark, scenic landmark  or  landmark
      site,  or  amendment  or modification thereof, to the zoning resolution,
      projected public improvements and any plans for the development, growth,
      improvement, or renewal of the area involved.
        (3) The council  may  approve,  disapprove  or  modify  such  proposed
      rescission within one hundred twenty days after a copy of the resolution
      proposing  same  is  filed  with  the  council,  provided  that the city
      planning  commission  has  submitted  the  report   required   by   this
      subdivision  or  that  sixty  days have elasped since the filing of such
      resolution. Failure to take action on such  proposed  rescission  within
      such  one hundred twenty-day period shall be deemed a vote to disapprove
      such proposed rescission. All votes of  the  council  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall  be  filed by the council with the mayor and shall be
      final unless disapproved by the mayor within five days of  such  filing.
      Any  such  mayoral  disapproval  shall  be  filed  by the mayor with the
      council and shall be subject to override by a  two-thirds  vote  of  the
      council  within  ten days of such filing. If such proposed rescission is
      approved or modified by the council,  such  rescission  or  modification
      thereof  shall  not  take  effect  until the time for disapproval by the
      mayor has expired; provided, however, that if the mayor disapproves such
      rescission or modification, it shall not take effect unless the  council
      overrides  the  mayor's  disapproval.  If  such  proposed  rescission is
    
      disapproved by the council, it shall not take effect  unless  the  mayor
      disapproves  such  council disapproval and the council fails to override
      the mayor's disapproval.
        i.  The  commission  may  at any time make recommendations to the city
      planning commission with respect to amendments of the provisions of  the
      zoning resolution applicable to improvements in historic districts.
        j.  All  designations  and  supplemental  designations  of  landmarks,
      landmark  sites,  interior  landmarks,  scenic  landmarks  and  historic
      districts  made  pursuant  to  subdivision  a  shall be made pursuant to
      notices of public hearings given, as  provided  in  section  25-313.  In
      addition  to  such  notice, the commission shall give notice to the city
      planning commission, all affected community boards and the office of the
      borough president in whose borough the property or district  is  located
      in advance of any public hearing relating to such designations.
        k. Upon its designation of any improvement parcel as a landmark and of
      any  landmark  site,  interior  landmark,  scenic  landmark  or historic
      district or any amendment of any such designation or rescission thereof,
      the commission shall cause to be recorded in the office of the  register
      of  the  city of New York in the county in which such landmark, interior
      landmark, scenic landmark or district lies, or in the case of landmarks,
      interior landmarks, scenic landmarks and  districts  in  the  county  of
      Richmond in the office of the clerk of said county of Richmond, a notice
      of  such  designation,  amendment  or  rescission  describing  the party
      affected by, in the case of the county of Richmond, its land  map  block
      number or numbers, and its tax map, block and lot number or numbers, and
      in  the case of all other counties, by its land map block and lot number
      or numbers.

Section 25-306 ::    
        
     
        §  25-306  Determination  of  request  for certificate of no effect on
      protected architectural features. a. (1) In any case where an  applicant
      for a permit from the department of buildings to construct, reconstruct,
      alter  or  demolish any improvement on a landmark site or in an historic
      district or containing an interior  landmark,  or  an  applicant  for  a
      special  permit  from  the  city  planning  commission  or  the board of
      standards and appeals authorizing any  such  work  pursuant  to  article
      seven  of  the zoning resolution, or amendments thereof, files a copy of
      such application or amended application with  the  commission,  together
      with a request for a certificate of no effect on protected architectural
      features,  the commission shall determine: (a) whether the proposed work
      would change, destroy or affect any exterior  architectural  feature  of
      the  improvement  on  a  landmark site or in an historic district or any
      interior architectural feature of the interior landmark upon which  said
      work  is  to  be  done;  and  (b)  in  the case of construction of a new
      improvement, whether such construction would affect or not be in harmony
      with the external appearance of other, neighboring improvements on  such
      site  or in such district. If the commission determines such question in
      the negative, it shall grant such certificate; otherwise, it shall  deny
      such request.
        (2)  Within  thirty  days  after  the  filing  of such application and
      request, the commission shall either grant  such  certificate,  or  give
      notice  to  the  applicant  of  a  proposed denial of such request. Upon
      written demand of the applicant filed  with  the  commission  after  the
      giving  of notice of a proposed denial, the commission shall confer with
      the  applicant.  The  commission  shall  determine  the  request  for  a
      certificate  within  thirty  days  after the filing of such demand. If a

      proposed denial, the commission shall determine such request within five
      days after the expiration of such ten-day period.
        (3)  In the event of a denial of such a certificate, the applicant may
      file with the commission a request for a certificate of  appropriateness
      with respect to the proposed work specified in such application.

--------------

Section 25-307 ::    
        
     
        § 25-307 Factors governing issuance of certificate of appropriateness.
      a.   In  any  case  where  an  applicant  for  a  permit  to  construct,
      reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, or in
      an historic district or containing  an  interior  landmark,  files  such
      application   with   the  commission  together  with  a  request  for  a
      certificate of appropriateness, and in any case where a  certificate  of
      no  effect  on  protected  architectural  features  is  denied  and  the
      applicant thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of  section  25-306  of
      this  chapter, files a request for a certificate of appropriateness, the
      commission  shall  determine  whether  the  proposed   work   would   be
      appropriate  for and consistent with the effectuation of the purposes of
      this chapter. If the commission's determination is in the affirmative on
      such question, it shall grant a certificate of appropriateness,  and  if
      the  commission's  determination  is  in the negative, it shall deny the
      applicant's request, except as otherwise provided in section  25-309  of
      this chapter.
        b.  (1)  In  making  such  determination  with  respect  to  any  such
      application for a permit to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish an
      improvement in an historic district, the commission shall  consider  (a)
      the  effect  of  the  proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or
      affecting the exterior architectural features of  the  improvement  upon
      which  such  work  is  to  be done, and (b) the relationship between the
      results of such work and the exterior architectural features  of  other,
      neighboring improvements in such district.
        (2)  In appraising such effects and relationship, the commission shall
      consider, in addition to any other pertinent  matters,  the  factors  of
      aesthetic,   historical   and  architectural  values  and  significance,
      architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, material and color.
        (3) All determinations of the commission pursuant to this  subdivision
      b  shall  be  made  subject  to the provisions of section 25-304 of this
      chapter, and the commission, in making any such determination, shall not
      apply any regulation, limitation, determination or restriction as to the
      height and bulk of buildings, the area of yards, courts  or  other  open
      spaces, density of population, the location of trades and industries, or
      location  of  buildings  designed  for  specific  uses,  other  than the
      regulations, limitations, determinations and  restrictions  as  to  such
      matters  prescribed  or  made by or pursuant to applicable provisions of
      law,  exclusive  of  this  chapter;  provided,  however,  that   nothing
      contained  in  such  section  25-304  or  in this subdivision b shall be
      construed as limiting the power of the commission to deny a request  for
      a  certificate  of  appropriateness  for  demolition or alteration of an
      improvement in an historic district (whether or not  such  request  also
      seeks  approval,  in such certificate, of construction or reconstruction
      of any improvement), on the ground that such  demolition  or  alteration
      would be inappropriate for and inconsistent with the effectuation of the
      purposes  of  this  chapter,  with  due  consideration  for  the factors
      hereinabove set forth in this subdivision b.
        c. In making the determination referred to in subdivision  a  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  any  application  for a permit to construct,
      reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, other
      than a landmark, the commission shall consider (1) the  effects  of  the
      proposed  work  in  creating,  changing,  destroying  or  affecting  the
      exterior architectural features of the improvement upon which such  work
      is  to be done, (2) the relationship between such exterior architectural
      features, together with such effects,  and  the  exterior  architectural
      features  of  the  landmark,  and (3) the effects of the results of such
      work upon the protection,  enhancement,  perpetuation  and  use  of  the
      landmark  on such site. In appraising such effects and relationship, the
    
      commission shall consider, in addition to any other  pertinent  matters,
      the factors mentioned in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.
        d.  In  making  the determination referred to in subdivision a of this
      section  with  respect  to  an  application  for  a  permit  to   alter,
      reconstruct  or  demolish  a landmark, the commission shall consider the
      effects  of  the  proposed  work  upon  the   protection,   enhancement,
      perpetuation  and  use  of  the  exterior architectural features of such
      landmark which cause it  to  possess  a  special  character  or  special
      historical or aesthetic interest or value.
        e.  In  making  the determination referred to in subdivision a of this
      section  with  respect  to  an  application  for  a  permit  to   alter,
      reconstruct  or demolish an improvement containing an interior landmark,
      the commission shall consider the effects of the proposed work upon  the
      protection,   enhancement,   perpetuation   and   use  of  the  interior
      architectural features of such  interior  landmark  which  cause  it  to
      possess  a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest
      or value.

      alterations  to  or  reconstruct  any  improvement on a landmark site or
      containing an interior landmark is filed with the  commission,  and  the
      applicant  requests  a certificate of appropriateness for such work, and
      the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the commission that:
        (a)  the  improvement  parcel  (or  parcels)   which   includes   such
      improvement,  as  existing at the time of the filing of such request, is
      not capable of earning a reasonable return; and
        (b) the owner of such improvement:
        (1) in the case of an application for a permit to demolish,  seeks  in
      good  faith to demolish such improvement immediately (a) for the purpose
      of constructing on the site thereof with  reasonable  promptness  a  new
      building  or  other income-producing facility, or (b) for the purpose of
      terminating the operation of the improvement at a loss; or
        (2) in the case of an application for a permit to make alterations  or
      reconstruct,   seeks   in  good  faith  to  alter  or  reconstruct  such
      improvement, with reasonable promptness, for the purpose  of  increasing
      the return therefrom;
      the  commission,  if it determines that the request for such certificate
      should be denied on the basis of the applicable standards set  forth  in
      section  25-307  of  this  chapter,  shall, within ninety days after the
      filing of the request for such certificate of  appropriateness,  make  a

      appropriateness  mentioned  in  paragraph  one  of this subdivision a is
      filed with the commission with respect to an improvement, the provisions
      of this section shall not apply  to  such  request  if  the  improvement
      parcel  which  includes  such  improvement has received, for three years
      next preceding the filing of such request,  and  at  the  time  of  such
      filing continues to receive, under any provision of law (other than this
      chapter  or section four hundred fifty-eight, four hundred sixty or four
      hundred seventy-nine of the real property tax law), exemption  in  whole
      or  in  part  from  real  property taxation; provided, however, that the

      agreement  to  sell an estate of freehold or to grant a term of at least
      twenty years in such improvement parcel, which agreement is  subject  to
      or contingent upon the issuance of the certificate of appropriateness or
      a notice to proceed;
    
        (b)  The  improvement  parcel  which  includes  such  improvement,  as
      existing at the time of the filing of such request,  would  not,  if  it
      were  not  exempt  in  whole  or in part from real property taxation, be
      capable of earning a reasonable return;
        (c)   Such   improvement  has  ceased  to  be  adequate,  suitable  or
      appropriate for use for carrying out both (1) the purposes of such owner
      to which it is devoted and (2) those  purposes  to  which  it  had  been
      devoted when acquired unless such owner is no longer engaged in pursuing
      such purposes; and
        (d) The prospective purchaser or tenant:
        (1)  In  the case of an application for a permit to demolish seeks and
      intends, in good faith either to demolish such  improvement  immediately
      for  the  purpose  of  constructing  on the site thereof with reasonable
      promptness a new building or other facility; or
        (2) In the case of an application for a permit to make alterations  or
      reconstruct,  seeks  and  intends  in good faith to alter or reconstruct
      such improvement, with reasonable promptness.
        b. In the case of an application made pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  a of this section by an applicant not required to establish
      the conditions specified  in  paragraph  two  of  such  subdivision,  as
      promptly  as  is practicable after making a preliminary determination as
      provided in paragraph one of such subdivision a,  the  commission,  with
      the aid of such experts as it deems necessary, shall endeavor to devise,
      in  consultation  with the applicant, a plan whereby the improvement may
      be (1) preserved or perpetuated in such manner or form as to  effectuate
      the purposes of this chapter, and (2) also rendered capable of earning a
      reasonable return.
        c.  Any  such  plan  may  include,  but  shall  not be limited to, (1)
      granting of partial or complete tax exemption, (2)  remission  of  taxes
      and  (3)  authorization  for alterations, construction or reconstruction
      appropriate for and  not  inconsistent  with  the  effectuation  of  the
      purposes of this chapter.
        d. In any case where the commission formulates any such plan, it shall
      mail  a  copy  thereof to the applicant promptly and in any event within
      sixty days after giving  notice  of  its  preliminary  determination  of
      insufficient  return.  The  commission  shall hold a public hearing upon
      such plan.
        e. (1) If the commission, after holding a public hearing  pursuant  to
      subdivision  d  of  this  section,  determines  that a plan which it has
      formulated, consisting only of tax exemption and/or remission of  taxes,
      meets  the standards set forth in subdivision b of this section, as such
      plan was originally  formulated,  or  with  such  modifications  as  the
      commission deems necessary or appropriate, the commission shall deny the
      request  of the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness and shall
      approve such plan, as originally formulated, or with such modifications.
        (2) Such plan, as so approved, shall  set  forth  the  extent  of  tax
      exemption  and/or  remission of taxes deemed necessary by the commission
      to meet such standards.
        (3) The commission shall  promptly  mail  a  certified  copy  of  such
      approved  plan  to the applicant and shall promptly transmit a certified
      copy thereof to the tax commission. Upon application made by  the  owner
      of such improvement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of this
      subdivision  e, the tax commission shall grant, for the fiscal year next
      succeeding the date of approval of such plan, the tax  exemption  and/or
      remission of taxes provided for therein.
        (4) In accordance with procedures prescribed by the regulations of the
      commission,  it  shall  determine, upon application by the owner of such
      improvement made in advance of each succeeding fiscal year,  the  amount
    
      of  tax  exemption  and/or  remission  of  taxes, if any, which it deems
      necessary, as a renewal of such plan for the ensuing year, to  meet  the
      standards set forth in subdivision b of this section, and shall promptly
      mail  a  certified  copy  of  any  approved  renewal of such plan to the
      applicant and shall promptly transmit a certified copy of  such  renewal
      to  the  tax  commission.  Upon  application  made  by the owner of such
      improvement pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph  five  of  this
      subdivision e, the tax commission shall grant, for such fiscal year, the
      tax exemption and/or remission of taxes specified in such determination.
        (5)  Where  any  such  plan  or  a  renewal thereof is approved by the
      commission, pursuant to the provisions of the  preceding  paragraphs  of
      this  subdivision  e,  prior  to January first next preceding the fiscal
      year to which the tax benefits of  such  plan  or  renewal  thereof  are
      applicable,  the  owner  shall not be entitled to such benefits for such
      fiscal year unless he or she files an application therefor with the  tax
      commission  between  February  first  and  March  fifteenth,  both dates
      inclusive, next preceding such fiscal year. Where any  such  plan  or  a
      renewal  thereof is approved by the commission between January first and
      June thirtieth, both dates inclusive, next preceding the fiscal year  to
      which  the  tax benefits of such plan or renewal thereof are applicable,
      the owner shall not be entitled to such benefits for  such  fiscal  year
      unless  he  or she files an application therefor with the tax commission
      on or before August first of such fiscal year.
        f. (1) In any case where the commission determines,  after  holding  a
      public  hearing  pursuant  to subdivision d of this section, that a plan
      which it has formulated, consisting in whole or in part of any  proposal
      other  than tax exemption and/or remission of taxes, meets the standards
      set forth in subdivision b of this section, as such plan was  originally
      formulated, or with such modifications as the commission deems necessary
      or  appropriate,  the  commission shall approve such plan, as originally
      formulated, or with such modifications, and shall promptly mail  a  copy
      of same to the applicant.
        (2) The owner of the improvement proposed to be benefited by such plan
      mentioned  in  paragraph  one of this subdivision f may accept or reject
      such plan by written acceptance or rejection filed with the  commission.
      If such an acceptance is filed, the commission shall deny the request of
      such   applicant   for  a  certificate  of  appropriateness.  If  a  new
      application for a permit from the department  of  buildings  and  a  new
      request   for   a   certificate  of  appropriateness  are  filed,  which
      application and request conform with such proposed plan, the  commission
      shall  grant  such  certificate as promptly as is practicable and in any
      event within thirty days after such filing.
        (3) If such accepted plan consists in part  of  tax  exemption  and/or
      remission  of  taxes,  the provisions of paragraphs two, three, four and
      five of subdivision e of this section shall govern the granting of  such
      tax exemption and/or remission of taxes.
        g.  (1)  Except in a case where the applicant is required to establish
      the conditions set forth in paragraph  two  of  subdivision  a  of  this
      section, if
        (a)  The commission does not formulate and mail a plan pursuant to the
      provisions of subdivisions b, c, and d of this section within the period
      of time prescribed by such subdivision d; or
        (b) The commission does not approve a plan pursuant to the  provisions
      of  subdivision  e  or  f  of  this  section within sixty days after the
      mailing of such plan to the applicant; or
        (c) A plan approved by the commission pursuant to  the  provisions  of
      paragraph  one of subdivision f of this section is rejected by the owner
    
      of such improvement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph two of  such
      subdivision;
      the  commission  may, within ten days after expiration of the applicable
      period referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this  paragraph  one,
      or within ten days after the filing of a rejection of a plan pursuant to
      paragraph  two  of  subdivision  f  of this section, as the case may be,
      transmit to the mayor a written recommendation that the city  acquire  a
      specified  appropriate  protective  interest  in  the improvement parcel
      which includes the improvement with respect to which the request  for  a
      certificate  of appropriateness was filed, and shall promptly notify the
      applicant of such action.
        (2) If, within ninety days after transmission of such  recommendation,
      or,  if  no such recommendation is transmitted, within ninety days after
      the expiration of the period herein prescribed  for  such  transmission,
      the city does not:
        (a)  Give  notice, pursuant to section three hundred eighty-two of the
      charter, of an  application  to  condemn  such  interest  or  any  other
      appropriate  protective  interest  agreed  upon  by  the  mayor  and the
      commission; or
        (b) Enter into a contract with the owner of such improvement parcel to
      acquire such interest, as so recommended or agreed upon;
      the commission shall promptly grant, issue and forward to the owner,  in
      lieu of the certificate of appropriateness requested by the applicant, a
      notice to proceed.
        h.  No  plan  which  consists in whole or in part of the granting of a
      partial or complete tax exemption or remission of taxes pursuant to  the
      provisions  of this chapter shall be deemed to have been approved by the
      commission unless it is also approved by the mayor  and  council  within
      the  period of time prescribed by this section for approval of such plan
      by the commission.
        i. (1) In any case where the applicant is required  to  establish  the
      conditions  set forth in paragraph two of subdivision a of this section,
      as promptly as is practicable after making a  preliminary  determination
      with  respect  to  such  conditions,  as  provided  in  paragraph one of
      subdivision a of this section, and within one hundred  and  eighty  days
      after  making  such  preliminary determination, the commission, alone or
      with the aid of such persons and agencies  as  it  deems  necessary  and
      whose  aid it is able to enlist, shall endeavor to obtain a purchaser or
      tenant (as the case may be) of the improvement parcel  or  parcels  with
      respect  to  which  the  application  has  been made, which purchaser or
      tenant will agree, without condition  or  contingency  relating  to  the
      issuance  of  a  certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed and
      subject to the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision  i,  to
      purchase  or  acquire  an  interest  identical  with that proposed to be
      acquired by the prospective purchaser or tenant whose agreement  is  the
      basis of the application, on reasonably equivalent terms and conditions.
        (2)  The applicant shall, within a reasonable time after notice by the
      commission that it has obtained such a purchaser or tenant, which notice
      shall be served within  the  period  of  one  hundred  and  eighty  days
      provided  by  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  i,  enter into such
      agreement to sell or lease (as the case may be) with  the  purchaser  or
      tenant  so  obtained. Such notice shall specify a date for the execution
      of such agreement, which may be  postponed  by  the  commission  at  the
      request of the applicant.
        (3)  The  provisions of this section shall not, after the consummation
      of such agreement, apply to such purchaser or tenant or  to  the  heirs,
      successors or assigns of such purchaser or tenant.
    
        (4)  (a)  If,  within  the one hundred eighty day period following the
      commission's preliminary determination  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  a  of this section, the commission shall not have succeeded
      in obtaining a purchaser or tenant of the improvement  parcel,  pursuant
      to  paragraph  one  of this subdivision i, or if, having obtained such a
      purchaser or tenant, such purchaser or  tenant  fails  within  the  time
      provided  in  paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision i, to enter into the
      agreement provided for by such paragraph  two,  the  commission,  within
      twenty  days  after  the expiration of the one hundred eighty day period
      provided for in paragraph one of this subdivision i,  or  within  twenty
      days  after  the  date  upon which a purchaser or tenant obtained by the
      commission pursuant to the provisions of such  paragraph  one  fails  to
      enter  into  the  agreement provided for by said paragraph, whichever of
      said  dates  later  occurs,  may  transmit  to  the  mayor   a   written
      recommendation  that the city acquire a specified appropriate protective
      interest  in  the  improvement  parcel  or  parcels  which  include  the
      improvement  or  are part of the landmark site with respect to which the
      request for a  certificate  of  appropriateness  was  filed,  and  shall
      promptly notify the applicant of such action.
        (b)  If, within ninety days after transmission of such recommendation,
      or, if no such recommendation is transmitted, within ninety  days  after
      the  expiration  of  the period herein prescribed for such transmission,
      the city does  not  give  notice,  pursuant  to  section  three  hundred
      eighty-two of the charter, of an application to condemn such interest or
      any  other  appropriate protective interest agreed upon by the mayor and
      the commission, or does not enter into a contract with the owner of such
      improvement parcel to acquire  such  interest,  as  so  recommended  and
      agreed  upon;  the commission shall promptly grant, issue and forward to
      the owner, in lieu of the certificate of  appropriateness  requested  by
      the applicant, a notice to proceed.
        (5)  Such  notice  to  proceed shall authorize the work of demolition,
      alteration, and/or reconstruction sought with respect to the improvement
      parcel or parcels concerning which the application  was  made,  only  if
      such  work  (a)  is  undertaken and performed by the purchaser or tenant
      specified pursuant to the provisions of paragraph two of  subdivision  a
      of this section, in the application, or a bona-fide assignee, successor,
      lessee  or  sub-lessee of such purchaser or tenant (other than the owner
      who made application therefor), and (b) is undertaken and performed with
      reasonable promptness after the issuance of such notice to proceed.

      in charge of an improvement located on a landmark site or in an historic
      district or containing an interior landmark to perform  any  minor  work
      thereon,  or  to  cause or permit such work to be performed, and for any
      other person to perform any such  work  thereon  or  cause  same  to  be
      performed,  unless  the commission has issued a permit, pursuant to this
      section, authorizing such work.
        (2) It shall be  unlawful  for  any  person  in  charge  of  any  such
      improvement to maintain same or cause or permit same to be maintained in
      the condition created by any work done in violation of the provisions of
      paragraph one of this subdivision a.
        b.  The  owner  of an improvement desiring to obtain such a permit, or
      any person authorized by the owner to perform such work, may  file  with
      the  commission an application for such permit, which shall include such
      description of the proposed work, as the commission may  prescribe.  The
      applicant  shall  submit  such  other  information  with  respect to the
      proposed work as the commission may  from  time  to  time  require.  The
      commission shall promptly transmit such application to the department of
      buildings,  which  shall,  as promptly as is practicable, certify to the
      commission whether a permit for  such  proposed  work,  issued  by  such
      department, is required by law. If such department certifies that such a
      permit  is  required,  the  commission  shall deny such application, and
      shall promptly give notice of such determination to  the  applicant.  If
      such   department  certifies  that  no  such  permit  is  required,  the
      commission shall determine such application as hereinafter provided.
        c. (1) The commission shall determine:
        (a) Whether the proposed work would  change,  destroy  or  affect  any
      exterior  architectural  feature of an improvement located on a landmark
      site or in an historic district or interior architectural feature of  an
      improvement containing an interior landmark; and
        (b)  If  such  work  would  have  such  effect,  whether judged by the
      standards set forth in subdivisions b, c, d and e of section  25-307  of
      this  chapter  with  respect to an improvement of similar classification
      hereunder, such work would be appropriate for and  consistent  with  the
      effectuation of the purposes of this chapter.
        (2)   If   the   commission  determines  the  question  set  forth  in
      subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision c in the negative,
      or determines the  question  set  forth  in  subparagraph  (b)  of  such
      paragraph  in  the affirmative, it shall grant such permit, and it shall
      deny  such  permit  if  it  determines  such  question  set   forth   in
      subparagraph  (a)  in  the  affirmative and determines such question set
      forth in subparagraph (b) in the negative.
        d. The procedure of the commission in making  its  determination  with
      respect  to  any such application shall be as prescribed in subparagraph
      two of subdivision a of section 25-306 of this chapter, except that  any
      period  of  thirty  days referred to in such subparagraph shall, for the
      purposes of this subdivision d, be deemed to be twenty days.
        e. The provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  inapplicable  to  any
      improvement mentioned in subdivision a of section 25-318 of this chapter
      and to any city-aided project.

      shall  keep  in  good  repair  (1)  all of the exterior portions of such
      improvement and (2) all interior  portions  thereof  which,  if  not  so

      of any minor work upon such improvement, for the  purpose  of  remedying
      conditions  determined  to  be  dangerous  to  life, health or property,
      nothing contained in this  chapter  shall  be  construed  as  making  it
      unlawful  for  any person, without prior issuance of a certificate of no
      effect  on  protected   architectual   features   or   certificates   of
      appropriateness  or  permit  for minor work pursuant to this chapter, to

        §  25-313  Public  hearings; conferences. a. The commission shall give
      notice of any public hearing which it is required or authorized to  hold
      under  the  provisions of this chapter by publication in the City Record
      for at least ten days immediately prior thereto.
        The owner of any improvement parcel on which a landmark or a  proposed
      landmark  is  situated or which is a part of a landmark site or proposed
      landmark site  or  which  contains  an  interior  landmark  or  proposed
      interior  landmark,  or any property which includes a scenic landmark or
      proposed scenic landmark shall be given notice  of  any  public  hearing
      relating  to  the  designation of such proposed landmark, landmark site,
      interior landmark or scenic landmark, the amendment to  any  designation
      thereof  or  the  proposed  rescission  of  any designation or amendment
      thereto. Such notice may be served by the commission by registered  mail
      addressed  to  the  owner  or  owners  at his or her or their last known
      address or addresses, as the same appear in the records of the office of
      the commissioner of finance or if there is no name in such records, such
      notice may be served by ordinary mail addressed to "Owner" at the street
      address of the improvement parcel or property in  question.  Failure  by
      the  commission  to give such notices shall not invalidate or affect any
      proceedings pursuant to this chapter relating to such improvement parcel
      or property.
        b.  At  any  such  public  hearing,  the  commission  shall  afford  a
      reasonable  opportunity for the presentation of facts and the expression
      of views by those desiring to be heard, and may, in its discretion, take
      the testimony of witnesses and receive evidence; provided, however, that
      the commission, in determining any matter as to which any  such  hearing
      is  held,  shall  not  be confined to consideration of the facts, views,
      testimony or evidence submitted at such hearing.
        c. The commission may delegate to any member or  members  thereof  the
      power  to  conduct  any  such  public hearing and to hold any conference
      required to be held under the provisions of sections 25-306  and  25-310
      of this chapter.
        d.  The  commission, may, in its discretion, direct that notice of any
      such public hearing on a request for a certificate  of  appropriateness,
      or  on  any  plan  formulated  by the commission in relation thereto, be
      given by the applicant to such owners of property in the neighborhood of
      the improvement or improvement parcel to which such request relates,  as
      the  commission deems proper. When so directed, the applicant shall mail
      a notice of such hearing to such owners, at their last known  addresses,
      as  the  same appear in the records of the office of the commissioner of
      finance, and shall likewise mail a notice of such hearing to persons who
      have filed written requests for  such  notice  with  the  commission.  A
      reasonable  period  of  time,  as  prescribed  by the regulations of the
      commission, shall be afforded the applicant for giving  notice  of  such
      hearing  to such owners and persons. Any failure to give or receive such

Section 25-317.1 ::    
        
     
        §  25-317.1  Civil penalties. a. Any person who violates any provision
      of sections 25-305, 25-310 or 25-311 or subdivision c of section  25-317
      of  this  chapter  or any order issued by the chair with respect to such
      provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty which may be recovered by
      the corporation counsel in a civil action  in  any  court  of  competent
      jurisdiction. Such civil penalty shall be determined as follows:
        (1)  The  defendant  shall  be liable for a civil penalty of up to the
      fair market value  of  the  improvement  parcel,  with  or  without  the
      improvement,  whichever is greater, where in violation of such provision
      or order:
        (a) all or substantially all of an improvement on a landmark  site  or
      within a historic district has been demolished;
        (b) work has been performed or a condition created or maintained which
      significantly  impairs  the  structural integrity of an improvement on a
      landmark site or within a historic district;
        (c) work has been performed or a condition created or maintained which
      results in the destruction, removal or significant  alteration  of  more
      than  fifty  percent  of  the  square  footage  of  two  facades  of  an
      improvement on a landmark site or within a historic district,  including
      party and sidewalls; or
        (d)  the  defendant has failed to take action to prevent any condition
      described in subparagraph a, b or c of this paragraph from occurring.
        (2) Where, in violation of such provision or order, work is  performed
      or   a   condition  is  created  or  maintained  which  results  in  the
      destruction, removal or significant alteration of a significant  portion
      of  the  protected  features  identified in the designation report of an
      interior landmark, the defendant shall be liable  for  a  civil  penalty
      equal  to  two  times  the  estimated  cost of replicating the protected
      features that were demolished, removed or altered.
        (3) All other violations. The defendant shall be liable  for  a  civil
      penalty of not more than five thousand dollars.
        (4)  For the purposes of this subdivision, each day during which there
      exists any violation of the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision
      a of section 25-305 of this chapter or paragraph two of subdivision a of
      section 25-310 of this chapter or subdivision  a,  b  or  c  of  section
      25-311  of this chapter or any order issued by the chair with respect to
      such provisions shall constitute a separate violation.
        b. In addition to or as an alternative to  any  of  the  remedies  and
      penalties  provided  in  this  chapter,  any  person  who  violates  any
      provision of sections 25-305, 25-310  or  25-311  or  subdivision  c  of
      section  25-317  of  this  chapter or any order issued by the chair with
      respect to such provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty which may
      be recovered in  an  administrative  proceeding  before  the  office  of
      administrative  trials  and hearings, the environmental control board or
      other  administrative  tribunal  having  jurisdiction   as   hereinafter
      provided.
        (1)   An  administrative  proceeding  for  civil  penalties  shall  be
      commenced by the service of a notice of violation in accordance with the
      applicable law and rules governing the procedures of the  administrative
      tribunal  before  which  the  notice  of  violation  is returnable or as
      otherwise provided by  the  rules  of  the  commission.  The  notice  of
      violation  shall  identify the allegedly illegal conditions or work with
      reasonable  specificity.  As  used  in  this   subdivision,   the   term
      "reasonable specificity" shall mean a description of work or conditions,
      reasonably  described  given  the  circumstances, sufficient to inform a
      reasonable person that (1) work has been or is  being  done  without  an
      appropriate  approval  from  the  commission,  (2)  conditions have been
      created or are being maintained in violation of  this  chapter,  or  (3)
    
      there  has  been a failure to take action to prevent conditions that are
      in violation of this chapter. Such administrative  tribunal  shall  have
      the  power  to impose civil penalties in accordance with this chapter. A
      judgment  of  an administrative tribunal imposing civil penalties may be
      enforced by the commencement of a civil action or proceeding in a  court
      or   as  otherwise  authorized  by  the  applicable  law  governing  the
      procedures of such administrative tribunal. Prior to serving a notice of
      violation, the chair shall serve a  warning  letter  upon  a  respondent
      either  personally or by mail in the manner provided by the rules of the
      commission. The warning letter shall  inform  the  respondent  that  the
      chair  believes  the  respondent  has  violated  the  provisions of this
      chapter, shall  describe  generally  the  allegedly  illegal  conditions
      and/or  activities,  shall  warn  the respondent that the law authorizes
      civil penalties for such violations, and shall  provide  the  respondent
      with a grace period for removing or applying for a permit to legalize or
      otherwise  address  the  allegedly  illegal  conditions. No such warning
      letter shall be required prior to the service of a notice  of  violation
      where  (i) the subject violation is a second or subsequent offense, (ii)
      the subject violation is alleged to  be  an  intentional  violation,  or
      (iii)  the chair is seeking civil penalties for failure to comply with a
      stop work order, issued pursuant to this chapter.
        (2) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, where a
      respondent has  been  found  liable  for  or  admitted  liability  to  a
      violation  of  this  chapter  in  an  administrative proceeding, a civil
      penalty for such violation shall  be  imposed  in  accordance  with  the
      schedule set forth below.
        (a)  Type  A  and Type B violations. (i) First offense. The respondent
      shall be liable for a civil penalty  of  not  more  than  five  thousand
      dollars.
        (ii)  Second  and  subsequent offenses. The respondent shall be liable
      for a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars a day for
      each day that a condition underlying  a  prior  violation  continues  to
      exist,  measured  from  the  date the respondent was found liable for or
      admitted liability to the prior violation, but in  no  event  shall  the
      civil  penalty  be  less  than  the maximum possible penalty for a first
      offense.
        (b) Type C violation. (i)  First  offense.  The  respondent  shall  be
      liable for a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars.
        (ii)  Second  and  subsequent offenses. The respondent shall be liable
      for a civil penalty of not more than fifty dollars a day  for  each  day
      that  a  condition  underlying  a  prior  violation  continues to exist,
      measured from the date the respondent  was  found  liable  for  or  pled
      guilty  to  the prior violation, but in no event shall the civil penalty
      be less than the maximum possible penalty for a first offense.
        (3) Notwithstanding the penalty schedule set forth  above,  the  chair
      may,  in  his  or her discretion, for good cause shown, recommend that a
      lesser  or  no  civil  penalty  be  imposed  on  a  respondent   in   an
      administrative proceeding.
        (4)  Restrictions  on  service  of  notice  of violation for second or
      subsequent offense. (a) The chair shall not serve a notice of  violation
      for a second or subsequent offense unless (i) more than twenty-five days
      have elapsed since the respondent was found liable or admitted liability
      in  the  prior  proceeding  and  (ii)  where the respondent in the prior
      proceeding has  submitted  an  application  to  the  commission  for  an
      appropriate  approval  to legalize or to undertake the work necessary to
      cure the condition underlying the prior  proceeding,  more  than  thirty
      days  have elapsed since such application has been disapproved or denied
      in whole or in part or if  granted,  such  approval  by  its  terms  has
    
      expired. If the respondent has filed more than one such application with
      the  commission,  the  thirty  day period shall commence after the first
      such application has been disapproved or denied in whole or in part  or,
      if granted, by its terms has expired.
        (b)  Nothing  in this subdivision shall prohibit the chair, subject to
      the rules of the administrative tribunal having  jurisdiction  over  the
      proceeding,  from serving an amended notice of violation for the purpose
      of clarifying the allegedly illegal conditions referred to in the  prior
      notice  of  violation,  or from serving a subsequent notice of violation
      that alleges separate violations of this chapter. An amended  notice  of
      violation  shall  be  returnable  on  the  same date and before the same
      administrative body as the initial notice of violation.
        (5)  Multiple  violations  incurred  for  the  same  work.  If   work,
      reasonably  identified  in  a  notice  of violation, was done without an
      appropriate approval from the commission, the total amount of any  civil
      penalty  for  such  work shall be determined by, to the extent feasible,
      separately considering and assessing a penalty for  each  type  of  work
      and/or  each  distinct effect on the protected features of the landmark,
      interior landmark or improvement in an historic district.  In  no  event
      shall  the  civil  penalty  exceed  five  thousand  dollars  for a first
      offense. Where the respondent is the owner, separate penalties shall not
      be assessed for each type of work and/or each  distinct  effect  if  the
      illegal  work  was  performed  during a period of time when the premises
      were leased to and under the control of a person other than the owner.
        (6) Grace period.  (a)  No  civil  penalty  shall  be  imposed  in  an
      administrative  proceeding  for a first violation if prior to the return
      date of the notice of violation, the respondent concedes  liability  for
      the  violation  and  supplies the commission with proof, satisfactory to
      the commission, that the violation has been corrected. If the respondent
      makes any misrepresentation or  omission  of  a  material  fact  to  the
      commission  regarding the removal of the violation, the respondent shall
      be liable for a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars.
        (b) No civil penalty shall be imposed in an administrative  proceeding
      for  a  first  violation  if  prior  to the return date of the notice of
      violation the  respondent  concedes  liability  for  the  violation  and
      submits  an application to the commission for approval to legalize or to
      undertake the work necessary to cure the violation.
        (c) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to  a  second  or
      subsequent offense or where the respondent is alleged to have violated a
      stop  work  order  or  where  the respondent has after the issuance of a
      warning letter pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (b)  of  section
      25-317.1  applied for and received a permit to cure or otherwise address
      a violation, and  the  respondent  has  failed  to  cure  the  violation
      pursuant to the terms of such permit.

Section 25-317.2 ::    
        
     
        § 25-317.2 Violations of landmarks laws: enforcement.
        a.  Stop-work  orders.  (1) An order to stop work may be issued by the
      chair, or his or her authorized representative, at  any  time  when  the
      chair  reasonably  believes that work is being performed in violation of
      the provisions of this chapter. Each order issued  by  the  chair  shall
      have  his  or her signature affixed thereto, but the chair may authorize
      any subordinate to affix such signature.
        (2) Such order may be given orally or in writing to a person in charge
      or apparently in charge of the improvement or involved in the work being
      performed thereon or may be served on the owner or person in  charge  of
      the  improvement parcel as otherwise provided in the commission's rules.
      The police department and the department of buildings  shall,  upon  the
      request  of  the  chair,  assist  the  chair  in the enforcement of such
      orders. Where the order is given orally a written notice of  such  order
      shall be mailed to the person to whom the order was addressed or affixed
      to  the  premises  where the violation occurred within forty-eight hours
      after service of such oral order.
        b. Contents of orders. All stop work orders issued by the chair  shall
      identify  the  allegedly  illegal  conditions  or  work  with reasonable
      specificity.  As  used  in  this  subdivision,  the   term   "reasonable
      specificity"  shall mean a description of work or conditions, reasonably
      described given the circumstances, sufficient  to  inform  a  reasonable
      person  that  (1)  work has been or is being done without an appropriate
      approval from the commission or (2) conditions have been created or  are
      being  maintained  in  violation  of  this chapter. The order shall also
      identify the subject premises  by  the  tax  block  and  lot  or  street
      address,   and  shall  be  addressed  to  a  person  in  charge  of  the
      improvement, or to a person who is alleged to have created  the  illegal
      conditions  or  performed, authorized, overseen or permitted the illegal
      work. The chair may issue a separate order to  each  person  who,  as  a
      result  of  the  same condition or work, is alleged to have violated the
      provisions of this chapter.
        c. In addition to any of the remedies or  penalties  provided  for  in
      this  section, failure to comply with a stop work order shall be subject
      to the payment of a civil penalty in the sum of five hundred dollars for
      each day there is non-compliance, to be  recovered  in  a  civil  action
      brought  in  the  name  of  the chair or in an administrative proceeding
      before  the  office  of  administrative   trials   and   hearings,   the
      environmental  control  board  or  other  administrative tribunal having
      jurisdiction.
        d. Enforcement proceedings. (1) Upon the violation of any provision of
      this chapter, or the failure to comply with any stop-work  order  issued
      by the chair thereunder, or whenever any person is about to engage in or
      is  engaging  in  any act or practice that may constitute a violation of
      any provision of this chapter, the chair  may  request  the  corporation
      counsel  to  institute  all  necessary  actions  and/or  proceedings  to
      restrain, correct or abate such violation  or  potential  violation,  to
      compel  compliance  with  such  order  and/or  to  seek  civil penalties
      pursuant to this chapter. The corporation  counsel  may  institute  such
      actions  or  proceedings  as  may  be necessary and appropriate for such
      purposes.
        (2) Such actions and proceedings may be instituted by the  corporation
      counsel   in   the  name  of  the  city  in  any  court  of  appropriate
      jurisdiction. In such actions or proceedings, the  city  may  apply  for
      restraining   orders,   preliminary  injunctions  or  other  provisional
      remedies, with or without notice.
        e. Notice  of  violation;  presumptive  evidence.  In  any  action  or
      proceeding  founded  upon  a  claim  by  the  chair that any law or rule
    
      enforceable by the commission has been violated, or that a lawful  order
      issued  by  the  chair has not been complied with, a notice of violation
      shall be presumptive evidence of any matter stated therein.
        f.  In  addition  to  police  officers,  officers and employees of the
      commission and employees of other city agencies designated by the  chair
      may  enforce  the provisions of this chapter and may issue summonses and
      appearance tickets returnable in  the  criminal  court  and  notices  of
      violation  returnable before the environmental control board, the office
      of administrative trials and hearings or other  administrative  tribunal
      having jurisdiction.

Section 25-322 ::    
        
     
        §  25-322 Notification; lease notification. a. Upon designation by the
      commission of any improvement or property  as  a  landmark  and  of  any
      landmark  site, interior landmark or historic district, or any amendment
      of such designation, the owner of such improvement or property shall  be
      notified  in  writing of such designation by the commission. Such notice
      shall be sent to the owner or owners at his or her or their  last  known
      address or addresses, as the same appear in the records of the office of
      the commissioner of finance or if there is no name in such records, such
      notice  may  be  sent to the street address of the improvement parcel or
      property  in  question,  addressed  to  "Owner".  The  failure  by   the
      commission to give notice of designation as required by this subdivision
      shall  not  invalidate  or affect any actions or proceedings pursuant to
      this chapter relating to such improvement  parcel  or  property,  except
      that  no action or proceeding pursuant to subparagraph d of this section
      shall be commenced until thirty days after such notice has been given.
        b. It shall be the duty of  the  owner  or  person  in  charge  of  an
      improvement  or  property  that  is  a landmark, interior landmark or is
      located on a landmark site or within an historic district to ensure that
      every lease or sublease, or renewal thereof, between the owner  or  such
      other  person  in charge as lessor and a nonresidential tenant as lessee
      and concerning such improvement or  property  shall  contain  a  notice,
      conspicuously  set  forth  therein,  stating  that  in  accordance  with
      sections 25-305, 25-306, 25-309 or 25-310 of  this  chapter  the  lessee
      must  obtain a permit from the commission before commencing any exterior

      repair  and  maintenance  as  that  term  is defined in subdivision r of
      section 25-302 of this chapter.  When  an  improvement  or  property  is
      designated  a  landmark,  interior  landmark  or  as part of an historic
      district during the term of a lease or sublease of all or a  portion  of
      such  improvement  or  property,  the  lessor  of such lease or sublease
      shall, within thirty days  after  being  notified  in  writing  of  such
      designation  by  the  commission  or  a person in charge, send a written
      notice as described above to all nonresidential lessees of such  lessor.
      Such  notice  shall  be  sent  by  certified  or registered mail, return
      receipt requested to all nonresidential lessees on the first two  floors
      of  the  improvement  or  property,  and  shall  be  sent  to  all other
      nonresidential lessees by any means reasonably designed to  ensure  that
      notice is given.
        c.  The  commission  shall  promulgate  such  regulations  as it deems
      necessary to comply with the provisions of this section, with respect to
      notice requirements in all nonresidential leases for buildings under its
      jurisdiction.
        d. Any person who violates subdivision  b  of  this  section,  or  the
      regulations  promulgated  hereunder, shall be subject to a civil penalty
      of not more than five hundred  dollars  per  violation  which  shall  be
      returnable to the environmental control board.
