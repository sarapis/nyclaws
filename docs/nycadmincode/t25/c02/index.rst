      supreme court a petition duly verified, setting forth that such decision
      is  illegal,  in  whole  or  in  part,  specifying  the  grounds  of the
      illegality. Such petition must be presented to a justice of the  supreme
      court or at a special term of the supreme court within thirty days after
      the filing of the decision in the office of the board.
        b.  Order  of  certiorari. Upon the presentation of such petition, the
      justice or court may allow an order of certiorari directed to the  board
      to  review  such  decision  and  shall prescribe therein the time within

      certified  or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be
      called for by such order. The return must concisely set forth such other
      facts as may be pertinent and  material  to  show  the  grounds  of  the
      decisions appealed from and must be verified.
        d.  Proceedings  upon return. If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to
      the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of  the
      matter,  it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence
      as it may direct and report the same  to  the  court  with  his  or  her
      findings  of  fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part
      of the proceedings upon which the determination of the  court  shall  be
      made.  The  court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify
      the decision brought up for review.
        e. Costs. Costs shall not be allowed  against  the  board,  unless  it
      shall  appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad
      faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from.
        f. Preferences. All issues in any proceeding under this section  shall
      have preference over all other civil actions and proceedings.
