      finance  board  shall  not disclose that any specific contributor is the
      spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated  child  of  such  a  lobbyist,

      "unemancipated  child"  shall  mean  any  son,  daughter,   stepson   or
      stepdaughter  who  is  under  age  eighteen, unmarried and living in the

      such officer or employee.

      a  statement  of  registration  later  than  the  deadline  contained in
      paragraph two of subdivision (a) of this section, the city  clerk  shall
      forward  notice of such extension no later than the end of the following

      due date thereof  has  been  duly  designated  to  make  and  file  such
      statement or report.
        (2)  Any lobbyist or client who has never previously filed a statement
      of registration or any other report required by this subchapter shall be
      charged a late filing penalty of ten dollars for  each  day  a  required
      statement  or  report  is  late. If more than one statement or report is
      late, the total late filing penalty shall be equal to  the  sum  of  ten
      dollars  per  day  multiplied  by  the number of such late statements or
      reports. Any other lobbyist or client shall be  charged  a  late  filing
      penalty  of  twenty-five  dollars  for  each day a required statement or
      report is late. If more than one statement or report is late, the  total
      late filing penalty shall be equal to the sum of twenty-five dollars per
      day  multiplied  by  the number of such late statements or reports. Late
      filing penalties may be waived or reduced at the discretion of the  city
      clerk. A lobbyist or client seeking a waiver or reduction of late filing
      penalties  shall  submit  documentation as required by the city clerk. A
      decision to grant such a waiver or reduction shall be made in writing by
      the city clerk. The city clerk shall take  the  following  factors  into
      account in determining whether a waiver or reduction is appropriate:
        (i) whether and how often the lobbyist or client has filed late in the
      past;
        (ii) the annual operating budget of the lobbyist or client;
        (iii) whether the lobbyist lobbies solely on its own behalf;
        (iv)  for  periodic reports, the number of lobbying matters, number of
      hours spent working on those matters, and  amount  of  compensation  and
      expenditures that were not reported during the relevant period; and
        (v)  the significance of the impediments to timely filing faced by the
      lobbyist or client.

        (d) Any person or organization who  violates  any  provision  of  this
      subchapter  not  punishable  under  subdivisions (a), (b) or (c) of this
      section shall be subject to a civil penalty, in an amount not to  exceed
      twenty thousand dollars, to be assessed by the city clerk.
        (e)  Any  civil  penalty  to be assessed under subdivision (d) of this
      section, or any order issued under subdivision (a) of this section,  may
      only  be  imposed  or  issued  after written notice of violation and the
      expiration of fourteen business days from the date of  mailing  of  such
      notice. If such violation is cured within such fourteen-day period, then
      such civil penalty or order shall not be imposed or issued.
        (f)  The  amount  of  any  assessment made or duration of order issued
      pursuant to this section shall be determined only  after  a  hearing  at
      which the party shall be entitled to appear and be heard. Any assessment
      imposed  under this section may be recovered in an action brought by the
      corporation counsel.
        (g) The city clerk shall be charged with the  duty  of  reviewing  all
      statements  and  reports  required under this subchapter for violations,
      and it shall be his duty, if he deems such to be wilful, to report  such
      determination  to  the department of investigation. Where the city clerk
      receives a report or otherwise suspects that  a  criminal  violation  of
      law,  other  than  a  violation of this subchapter, has been or may have
      been committed, the city clerk shall  report  any  information  relating
      thereto to the department of investigation.
        (h)  The  department  of investigation shall provide assistance to the
      city clerk for the purpose of training personnel who are responsible for
      the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this subchapter.
      The city clerk shall  develop  compliance  programs  for  lobbyists  and
      clients.
    
        * (i)(1) The city clerk shall by rule establish an amnesty program for
      any  lobbyist  who  was  required  to have filed, but has never filed, a
      statement of registration pursuant to section 3-213 of this  subchapter,
      or  any  client  who was required to have filed, but has never filed, an
      annual  report pursuant to section 3-217 of this subchapter, at any time
      on or after December tenth, two thousand six.
        (2) Any lobbyist or client intending to  participate  in  the  amnesty
      program may file a written notice of intent to participate with the city
      clerk  on  forms  prescribed  by the city clerk, stating his, her or its
      intention to participate in such program,  at  any  time  prior  to  the
      effective  date  of the amnesty program. The city clerk shall not assess
      any late filing penalties or any  civil  penalties  authorized  by  this
      section  that  could be assessed against any such lobbyist or client for
      the period from December tenth, two thousand six  to  the  date  of  the
      filing  of  such notice. Any lobbyist or client filing a notice pursuant
      to this paragraph shall comply with all applicable  provisions  of  this
      subchapter beginning on the day of such filing.
        (3)  Any  lobbyist  or  client intending to participate in the amnesty
      program, including any  lobbyist  or  client  who  has  filed  a  notice
      pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision, shall file a written
      application on forms prescribed by  the  city  clerk  on  or  after  the
      effective  date  of  the amnesty program, but prior to the expiration of
      such program. Such application shall include a summary, which shall meet
      the  requirements  of  the  city  clerk,  of  the  lobbying  activities,
      fundraising  activities  or political consulting activities performed by
      such lobbyist or received by such client from  one  year  prior  to  the
      effective date of the amnesty program until the date of such application
      or  valid  filing  pursuant  to  paragraph two of this subdivision. Such
      amnesty program shall provide that upon the filing of  such  application
      and  upon  compliance with all applicable provisions of this subchapter,
      the city clerk shall waive any  late  filing  penalties  and  any  civil
      penalties  authorized by this section that could be assessed against any
      such lobbyist or client for the period from December tenth, two thousand
      six to the date of the filing of such application or, if the lobbyist or
      client  made  a  valid  filing  pursuant  to  paragraph  two   of   this
      subdivision,  to the date of such filing. In addition, any such lobbyist
      or client shall not be subject to any criminal penalties  authorized  by
      this section for the period from December tenth, two thousand six to the
      date  of  the  filing  of such application or, if the lobbyist or client
      made a valid filing pursuant to paragraph two of  this  subdivision,  to
      the date of such filing.
        (4)  The  term  of  the  amnesty  program established pursuant to this
      subdivision by rule of the city clerk shall not exceed six months, after
      which no application  for  amnesty  shall  be  accepted.  Prior  to  the
      commencement  of,  and during the term of, the amnesty program, the city
      clerk shall publicize the amnesty  program  so  as  to  maximize  public
      awareness  of  and  participation  in such program. The city clerk shall
      consult with city agencies and the city council to develop  notices  and
      advertisements  to  be  placed  in  print  and electronic media that are
      intended to reach persons and  organizations  doing  business  with  the
      city.
        (5) Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision to the contrary,
      any  lobbyist or client who is the subject of any criminal investigation
      relating to any violation of this subchapter and any lobbyist or  client
      who  is a party to any criminal litigation in any court of this state or
      the United States relating to any violation of this subchapter shall  be
      ineligible  to  file  the  notice  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of this
      subdivision or the application  pursuant  to  paragraph  three  of  this
    
      subdivision  or  to otherwise receive relief from late filing penalties,
      or civil or criminal penalties under  the  amnesty  program  established
      pursuant to this subdivision.
        (6)  The  city  clerk  shall  promulgate  such  rules, issue forms and
      instructions, and take any and all other actions necessary to  implement
      the provisions of this subdivision.
