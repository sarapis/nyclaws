Section 26-401 ::    
        
     
        §  26-401 Declaration and findings. a. The council hereby finds that a
      serious public  emergency  continues  to  exist  in  the  housing  of  a
      considerable  number of persons in the city, which emergency was created
      by war, the effects of war and the aftermath of hostilities;  that  such
      emergency  necessitated  the  intervention  of  federal, state and local
      government in order to prevent  speculative,  unwarranted  and  abnormal
      increases  in  rents; that there continues to exist an acute shortage of
      dwellings; that unless residential rents and evictions  continue  to  be
      regulated  and  controlled, disruptive practices and abnormal conditions
      will produce serious threats to the public health,  safety  and  general
      welfare;  that  to  prevent  such  perils to health, safety and welfare,
      preventive action through enactment of local legislation by the  council
      continues  to be imperative; that such action, as a temporary measure to
      be effective until it is determined by the council that  such  emergency
      no  longer exists, is necessary in order to prevent exactions of unjust,
      unreasonable and oppressive rents and rental agreements and to forestall
      profiteering, speculation and  other  disruptive  practices  tending  to
      produce   threats  to  the  public  health;  that  the  transition  from
      regulation to a normal market of free bargaining  between  landlord  and
      tenant,  while  still  the  objective  of state and city policy, must be
      administered with due regard  for  such  emergency;  that  in  order  to
      prevent  uncertainty,  hardship  and dislocation, the provisions of this
      chapter are declared to be necessary and designed to protect the  public
      health, safety and general welfare.
        b.  The council further declares that it is city policy to utilize the
      powers conferred by this  chapter,  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the
      purposes   and   provisions   thereof,  to  encourage  and  promote  the
      improvement and rehabilitation of the housing accommodations subject  to
      control  hereunder,  for  the  purpose  of protecting the public health,
      safety and general welfare.

      dangerous condition or detrimental to life or health; and the subsequent
      removal of the conditions on which such certification is based shall not

      applicable thereto, would not be subject  to  rent  control  under  this
      chapter  and  the regulations thereunder prior to the date on which rent
      control with respect to  such  multiple  dwelling  is  required  by  the
      provisions  of  such article eight to begin, this subparagraph (c) shall
      operate to make such housing accommodation subject to rent control under
      this chapter and the regulations thereunder only on and after such date;
      and provided further that if any such housing accommodation, on the date
      on which rent control with respect thereto ceases to be required by such
    
      article eight, would not  be  subject  to  rent  control,  or  would  be
      eligible   for  decontrol  on  the  landlord's  application,  under  the
      provisions of this chapter  and  the  regulations  thereunder,  if  this
      subparagraph   (c)  were  not  applicable  thereto,  then  such  housing
      accommodation, after such date, shall not be subject to rent control, or
      shall be eligible for decontrol, as the case may be, in the same  manner
      as  if  this  subparagraph  (c)  had not been applicable to such housing
      accommodation.
        2. The term "housing accommodation" shall not include:
        (a) structures in which all of the housing accommodations  are  exempt
      or  not  subject  to control under this chapter or any regulation issued

      house,  nor  shall  it  include  any  establishment  not  identified  or
      classified as  a  "hotel",  "transient  hotel"  or  "residential  hotel"
      pursuant  to the federal act, irrespective of whether such establishment
      either provides some services customarily  provided  by  hotels,  or  is
      represented  to  be  a hotel, or both; and provided further that housing
      accommodations in hotels which have been and still  are  occupied  by  a
      tenant who has resided in such hotel continuously since December second,

      vacated,  on or after the effective date of this first provision of this
      subparagraph (h), other than by voluntary surrender of possession or  in
      the  manner  provided in this chapter, and provided further that maximum

      accommodations, created  by  conversion  on  or  after  February  first,
      nineteen  hundred  forty-seven;  provided,  however,  that  any  housing
      accommodations created as a result of any such conversion  on  or  after
      May  first, nineteen hundred fifty, shall continue to be subject to rent
      control as provided for herein unless the state rent  commission,  prior
      to  May first, nineteen hundred sixty-two, issued an order decontrolling
      them, or the city rent agency, on or after such date,  issues  an  order
      decontrolling  them;  and the city rent agency shall issue such an order
      if there has been a structural change involving substantial  alterations
      or  remodeling  and  such  change  has  resulted  in  additional housing
      accommodations consisting of self-contained family units as  defined  by
      regulations  issued  by  the  city  rent agency, with due regard for the
      shortage of housing accommodations suitable for family occupancy and for
      the purposes of this chapter in relation thereto; and provided  further,
      that  any  such  order  of decontrol of the state rent commission or the
      city rent agency shall remain effective after April thirtieth,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-two  only  so  long as the housing accommodations are not
      occupied for other than single family occupancy; and  provided  further,
      that  any such order of decontrol shall not apply to that portion of the
      original housing accommodations occupied by a tenant  in  possession  at
      the time of the conversion, but only so long as that tenant continues in
      occupancy;  and  provided further, that no such order of decontrol shall
      be issued unless such conversion occurred after the entire structure, or
      any lesser portion thereof as may have been thus converted, was  vacated
      by  voluntary surrender of possession, or in the manner provided in this
      chapter,  or  (where  vacated  prior  to  May  first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-two) in the manner provided by section five of the state rent act;
      and   provided   further  that  notwithstanding  any  of  the  foregoing
      provisions of this item two, no such order of decontrol shall be  issued
      with  respect  to  housing  accommodations  of  any  type resulting from
      conversion,  after  April  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-two,  to
      rooming house accommodations or to single room occupancy accommodations,
      and   such   resulting  accommodations  shall  continue  to  be  housing
      accommodations subject to  rent  control  under  this  chapter  and  the
      regulation thereunder; or
        (3)  Housing accommodations rented after April first, nineteen hundred
      fifty-three, which were  or  are  continuously  occupied  by  the  owner
      thereof for a period of one year prior to the date of renting; provided,
    
      however,  that  this item three shall not apply where the owner acquired
      possession  of  the  housing  accommodation  after  the  issuance  of  a
      certificate  of  eviction  under  subdivision two of section five of the
      state  rent act or under subdivision b of section 26-408 of this chapter
      within the two year  period  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  such
      renting,  and  provided  further that this item three shall not apply to
      any such housing accommodation rented on or after  May  first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-two,  where  an exemption of any housing accommodation in
      the same building was obtained under paragraph (h) of subdivision two of
      section two of the state rent act or has been previously obtained  under
      this  item three; and provided further, that this exemption shall remain
      effective only so long as the housing accommodations  are  not  occupied
      for other than single family occupancy; or
        (4)  Housing  accommodations in one or two family houses which were or
      shall  become  vacant  on  or  after  April  first,   nineteen   hundred
      fifty-three;   provided,  however,  that  this  exemption  shall  remain
      effective only so long as the housing accommodations  are  not  occupied
      for other than single family occupancy; or
        (6)   (i)  Such  housing  accommodations  resulting  from  substantial
      demolition (as such accommodations are defined in this item six), as are
      decontrolled by order of the city rent agency pursuant to this item six;
      provided that all  housing  accommodations  resulting  from  substantial
      demolition  which  are  not so decontrolled shall continue to be housing
      accommodations subject to  rent  control  under  this  chapter  and  the
      regulations thereunder.
        (ii)  The  term  "housing  accommodation  resulting  from  substantial
      demolition", as used herein, shall mean any  housing  accommodation  (a)
      which is created on or after May first, nineteen hundred sixty-two, as a
      result  of  the  substantial  demolition  of a multiple dwelling and the
      reconstruction of such building in such manner as to retain any  portion
      thereof  existing  prior to such demolition, and (b) which is so created
      after the issuance of one or more certificates permitting  the  eviction
      of  any  tenant  or tenants of such multiple dwelling for the purpose of
      effecting such demolition.
        (iii) No order shall be issued under this item six  decontrolling  any
      housing  accommodation  resulting  from  substantial  demolition unless,
      after such reconstruction, all housing accommodations  in  the  building
      are  self-contained family units as defined by regulations issued by the
      city  rent  agency,  with  due  regard  for  the  shortage  of   housing
      accommodations  suitable  for  family  occupancy and for the purposes of
      this chapter in relation thereto.
        (iv) The city rent agency shall issue regulations, with due regard for
      such  shortage  and  purposes,  specifying  minimum   requirements   for
      qualifying   any   housing   accommodation  resulting  from  substantial
      demolition as suitable for occupancy by larger families (including, with
      respect to the individual unit, but not limited  to,  number  of  rooms,
      space  suitable for sleeping purposes and total floor area) and likewise
      prescribing, subject to such  variations  and  classifications  as  such
      agency  may  determine to be reasonably necessary, the ratio between the
      total  number  of  housing  accommodations  resulting  from  substantial
      demolition  in the building, and the number of such accommodations which
      must meet such requirements for larger family occupancy, in order that a
      decontrol order may be granted hereunder.
        (v) The city rent agency shall issue an order decontrolling all of the
      housing accommodations resulting  from  substantial  demolition  in  the
      building, if such accommodations meet the requirements of sub-item (iii)
      of  this  item  six,  and if the prescribed proportion thereof meets the
      requirements of sub-item  (iv)  of  this  item  six  for  larger  family
    
      occupancy;  provided  that  (a)  if  all  such  accommodations  meet the
      requirements of such  sub-item  (iii),  but  less  than  the  prescribed
      proportion thereof meet the requirements of such sub-item (iv), then the
      city   rent  agency  shall  issue  an  order  decontrolling  only  those
      accommodations which meet the requirements of both such  sub-items;  and
      (b)  any  order  of  decontrol  issued  under this item six shall remain
      effective only so long as the accommodations decontrolled by such  order
      are not occupied for other than single family occupancy.
        (vi)  In  the  case  of any housing accommodations vacated on or after
      March twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred sixty-four, no order  of  decontrol
      shall  be  issued  under  this  item  six for any housing accommodations
      resulting from substantial demolition thereof unless such reconstruction
      occurred after the structure  was  vacated  by  voluntary  surrender  of
      possession, or in the manner provided in this chapter; or
        (7)  (i)  Individual housing accommodations having unfurnished maximum
      rents of two hundred and fifty dollars or more per  month  as  of  April
      first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty,  or  furnished  maximum rents of three

      sixty, which are or become vacant on or after the effective date of this
      item seven; or
        (ii)   On   and  after  October  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-four

      hundred sixty, or furnished maximum rents of  three  hundred  and  sixty
      dollars  or  more  per  month as of April first, nineteen hundred sixty;
      provided, however, that where any such housing accommodation is occupied
      by a tenant whose household contains one or more children  attending  an
      elementary   or  secondary  school,  such  housing  accommodation  shall
      continue to remain  subject  to  control  under  this  chapter  and  the
      regulations   thereunder   until   June   thirtieth,   nineteen  hundred
      sixty-five; and provided further, that where such housing  accommodation
      on  March  twenty-sixth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-four is occupied by a
      tenant whose household contains four or more related persons,  it  shall
      continue  to  remain  subject  to  control  under  this  chapter and the
      regulations thereunder so long as such tenant remains in occupancy; or
        (iii) On and after April first, nineteen hundred sixty-five individual
      housing accommodations having unfurnished maximum rents of  two  hundred
      and  fifty  dollars  to  two hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine
      cents, inclusive, per month as of April first, nineteen  hundred  sixty,
      or  furnished  maximum  rents  of three hundred dollars to three hundred
      fifty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents  inclusive,  per  month  as  of
      April  first,  nineteen hundred sixty; provided, however, that where any
      such housing accommodation is  occupied  by  a  tenant  whose  household
      contains  one  or  more  children  attending  an elementary or secondary
      school, such housing accommodation shall continue to remain  subject  to
      control  under  this  chapter  and the regulations thereunder until June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five; and provided further, that where
      such housing accommodations  on  March  twenty-sixth,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-four is occupied by a tenant whose household contains four or more
      related  persons,  it  shall continue to remain subject to control under
      this chapter and the regulations  thereunder  so  long  as  such  tenant
      remains in occupancy.
        (iv)  The  exemptions  provided  for  in  this item seven shall remain
      effective only so long as the housing accommodations  are  not  occupied
      for other than single family occupancy.
        (v)  The  term "related persons", as used in this item seven, shall be
      limited to the tenant  and  a  parent,  grandparent,  child,  stepchild,
      grandchild, brother or sister of the tenant or of the tenant's spouse or

      in occupancy.
        (8)  No more than two housing accommodations in any one year period in
      an  owner-occupied   structure   containing   six   or   fewer   housing
      accommodations  which  are  or  become  vacant on or after August first,
      nineteen hundred seventy, by voluntary surrender or pursuant to  section
      26-408  of  this  chapter;  provided, however, that this exemption shall
      remain effective only so long as  the  housing  accommodations  are  not
      occupied  for  other  than  residential  dwelling purposes; and provided
      further, that if the city rent agency shall make a finding of harassment
      in violation of subdivision d of section 26-412  of  this  chapter  with
      respect to a housing accommodation in a structure containing six or less
      housing  accommodations,  in  addition  to  all  other criminal or civil
      fines,  penalties,  injunctive  relief  and  enforcement  penalties  and
      remedies  authorized  by  section  26-413  of  this  chapter, no housing
      accommodation in such structure shall be decontrolled pursuant  to  this
      item  eight  until a minimum period of three years has elapsed since the

      exemption  shall  not  apply or become effective with respect to housing
      accommodations which the commissioner determines or finds became  vacant
      because  the  landlord  or  any person acting on his or her behalf, with
      intent to cause the tenant to vacate, engaged in any course  of  conduct
      (including  but  not  limited  to,  interruption  or  discontinuance  of
      essential services) which interfered with or disturbed or  was  intended
      to  interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the
      tenant in his or her use or occupancy of the housing accommodations  and
      provided,  further,  however,  that  nothing  contained  herein shall be
      deemed to preclude the applicability to such housing  accommodations  of
      the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four.
        (10)  Housing accommodations not occupied by the tenant, not including
      subtenants or occupants, as his or her primary residence, as  determined
      by  a  court  of competent jurisdiction. For the purposes of determining
      primary residency, a tenant who is a victim  of  domestic  violence,  as
      defined in section four hundred fifty-nine-a of the social services law,
      who  has  left  the  unit  because  of such violence, and who asserts an
      intent to return to the housing accommodation  shall  be  deemed  to  be
      occupying  the  unit  as  his  or  her  primary  residence. No action or
      proceeding shall be commenced  seeking  to  recover  possession  on  the
      ground that a housing accommodation is not occupied by the tenant as his
      or  her  primary  residence  unless the owner or lessor shall have given
      thirty days notice to the tenant of his or  her  intention  to  commence
      such action or proceeding on such grounds.
        (j)  Upon  the  issuance  of an order of deregulation by the division,
      housing accommodations which: (1) are occupied by  persons  who  have  a
      total  annual  income,  as defined in and subject to the limitations and
      process set forth in section 26-403.1 of this chapter, in excess of  the
    
      deregulation  income  threshold,  as defined in section 26-403.1 of this
      chapter, in each of the two preceding calendar years;  and  (2)  have  a
      maximum  rent that equals or exceeds the deregulation rent threshold, as
      defined in section 26-403.1 of this chapter. Provided however, that this
      exclusion  shall  not  apply  to  housing accommodations which became or
      become subject to this law by virtue of receiving tax benefits  pursuant
      to section four hundred eighty-nine of the real property tax law.
        (k)  Any  housing accommodation which becomes vacant on or after April
      first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven and before the  effective  date  of
      the  rent  act  of  2011,  and where at the time the tenant vacated such
      housing accommodation the maximum rent was two thousand dollars or  more
      per  month; or, for any housing accommodation which is or becomes vacant
      on or after the effective date of the rent regulation reform act of 1997
      and before the effective date of the rent act of  2011  with  a  maximum
      rent  of  two  thousand  dollars or more per month. This exclusion shall
      apply regardless  of  whether  the  next  tenant  in  occupancy  or  any
      subsequent tenant in occupancy is charged or pays less than two thousand
      dollars  a  month; or, for any housing accommodation with a maximum rent
      of two thousand five hundred dollars or more per month at any time on or
      after the effective date of the rent act of 2011, which  is  or  becomes
      vacant  on  or  after  such  effective  date. This exclusion shall apply
      regardless of whether the next tenant in  occupancy  or  any  subsequent
      tenant  in  occupancy actually is charged or pays less than two thousand
      five hundred dollars  a  month.  Provided  however,  that  an  exclusion
      pursuant  to this subparagraph shall not apply to housing accommodations
      which became or become subject to this law by virtue  of  receiving  tax
      benefits  pursuant  to  section  four  hundred  eighty-nine  of the real
      property tax law. This subparagraph shall  not  apply,  however,  to  or
      become  effective  with  respect  to  housing  accommodations  which the
      commissioner determines or finds that the landlord or any person  acting
      on  his  or  her  behalf, with intent to cause the tenant to vacate, has
      engaged in any  course  of  conduct  (including,  but  not  limited  to,
      interruption  or  discontinuance  of required services) which interfered
      with or disturbed or was intended  to  interfere  with  or  disturb  the
      comfort,  repose,  peace  or  quiet  of  the tenant in his or her use or
      occupancy of the housing accommodations  and  in  connection  with  such
      course  of  conduct, any other general enforcement provision of this law
      shall also apply.
        f."Landlord." An owner, lessor, sublessor, assignee, or  other  person
      receiving  or  entitled  to receive rent for the use or occupancy of any
      housing accommodation or an agent of any of the foregoing.

Section 26-403.1
----------------

Section 26-403.1 ::    
        
     
        §  26-403.1 High income rent deregulation. (a) 1. For purposes of this
      section, annual income shall mean the federal adjusted gross  income  as
      reported  on  the  New York state income tax return. Total annual income
      means the sum of the annual  incomes  of  all  persons  who  occupy  the
      housing  accommodation  as  their  primary  residence  other  than  on a
      temporary  basis,  excluding  bona  fide  employees  of  such  occupants
      residing  therein  in connection with such employment and excluding bona
      fide subtenants in occupancy pursuant to the provisions of  section  two
      hundred  twenty-six-b  of  the  real  property  law. In the case where a
      housing accommodation is sublet, the  annual  income  of  the  sublessor
      shall be considered.
        2.  Deregulation  income  threshold means total annual income equal to
      one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars in each of the  two  preceding
      calendar  years  for  proceedings  commenced  prior  to  July first, two
      thousand eleven. For proceedings commenced on or after July  first,  two
      thousand  eleven,  the  deregulation  income  threshold  means the total
      annual income equal to two hundred thousand dollars in each of  the  two
      preceding calendar years.
        3.   Deregulation  rent  threshold  means  two  thousand  dollars  for
      proceedings commenced  before  July  first,  two  thousand  eleven.  For
      proceedings  commenced  on or after July first, two thousand eleven, the
      deregulation rent threshold means two thousand five hundred dollars.
        (b) On or before the first day of May in each calendar year, the owner
      of each housing accommodation for  which  the  maximum  rent  equals  or
      exceeds  the  deregulation  rent  threshold  may  provide  the tenant or
      tenants residing therein with an income certification form  prepared  by
      the  division  of  housing and community renewal on which such tenant or
      tenants shall identify all persons referred to  in  subdivision  (a)  of
      this  section  and  shall  certify whether the total annual income is in
      excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding
      calendar years. Such income certification  form  shall  state  that  the
      income  level  certified to by the tenant may be subject to verification
      by the department of  taxation  and  finance  pursuant  to  section  one
      hundred seventy-one-b of the tax law and shall not require disclosure of
      any  income  information other than whether the aforementioned threshold
      has been exceeded. Such income certification form  shall  clearly  state
      that:  (i)  only tenants residing in housing accommodations which have a
      maximum monthly rent  that  equals  or  exceeds  the  deregulation  rent
      threshold  are  required  to  complete the certification form; (ii) that
      tenants have protections available to them which are designed to prevent
      harassment;  (iii)  that  tenants  are  not  required  to  provide   any
      information regarding their income except that which is requested on the
      form   and  may  contain  such  other  information  the  division  deems
      appropriate.  The  tenant  or  tenants  shall   return   the   completed
      certification  to  the  owner  within thirty days after service upon the
      tenant or tenants.  In  the  event  that  the  total  annual  income  as
      certified  is  in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each of
      the two preceding calendar years, the owner may file  the  certification
      with  the  state  division of housing and community renewal on or before
      June thirtieth of such year. Upon filing  such  certification  with  the
      division, the division shall, within thirty days after the filing, issue
      an  order  of  deregulation  providing  that such housing accommodations
      shall not be subject to the provisions of this law as of the  first  day
      of  June  in the year next succeeding the filing of the certification by
      the owner. A copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified
      mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant  or  tenants  and  a  copy
      thereof shall be mailed to the owner.
    
        (c)  1.  In the event that the tenant or tenants either fail to return
      the completed certification to the owner on or before the date  required
      by   subdivision   (b)  of  this  section  or  the  owner  disputes  the
      certification returned by the tenant or tenants, the owner  may,  on  or
      before  June  thirtieth  of  such  year,  petition the state division of
      housing and community renewal to verify, pursuant to section one hundred
      seventy-one-b of the tax law, whether the total  annual  income  exceeds
      the  deregulation income threshold in each of the two preceding calendar
      years. Within twenty days after the filing  of  such  request  with  the
      division,  the  division  shall  notify  the tenant or tenants that such
      tenant or tenants must provide the division with such information as the
      division and the department of taxation and  finance  shall  require  to
      verify  whether  the total annual income exceeds the deregulation income
      threshold in each of the two preceding calendar  years.  The  division's
      notification  shall  require  the  tenant  or  tenants  to  provide  the
      information to the division within  sixty  days  of  service  upon  such
      tenant  or  tenants  and shall include a warning in bold faced type that
      failure to respond will result in an order of deregulation being  issued
      by the division for such housing accommodation.
        2. If the department of taxation and finance determines that the total
      annual  income is in excess of the deregulation income threshold in each
      of the two preceding calendar years, the division shall,  on  or  before
      November  fifteenth  of  such  year, notify the owner and tenants of the
      results of such verification. Both the owner and the tenants shall  have
      thirty days within which to comment on such verification results. Within
      forty-five days after the expiration of the comment period, the division
      shall,  where appropriate, issue an order of deregulation providing that
      such housing accommodation shall not be subject  to  the  provisions  of
      this  law  as  of the first day of March in the year next succeeding the
      filing of the owner's petition with the division. A copy of  such  order
      shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested,
      to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall be sent to the owner.
        3.  In the event the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information
      required pursuant to paragraph one of  this  subdivision,  the  division
      shall  issue,  on  or  before  December  first of such year, an order of
      deregulation providing that such  housing  accommodation  shall  not  be
      subject  to  the  provisions of this law as of the first day of March in
      the year next succeeding the last day on which  the  tenant  or  tenants
      were  required  to provide the information required by such paragraph. A
      copy of such order shall be mailed by regular and certified mail, return
      receipt requested, to the tenant or tenants and a copy thereof shall  be
      sent to the owner.
        4.  The  provisions  of the state freedom of information act shall not
      apply to any income information obtained by  the  division  pursuant  to
      this section.
        (d) This section shall apply only to subparagraph (j) of paragraph two
      of subdivision e of section 26-403 of this chapter.
        (e)  Upon  receipt  of  such  order  of  deregulation pursuant to this
      section, an owner shall offer the housing accommodation subject to  such
      order  to  the  tenant at a rent not in excess of the market rent, which
      for the purposes of this section means a rent  obtainable  in  an  arm's
      length  transaction.  Such  rental  offer  shall be made by the owner in
      writing to the tenant by certified and regular mail and shall inform the
      tenant that such offer must be accepted in writing within  ten  days  of
      receipt.  The tenant shall respond within ten days after receipt of such
      offer.  If the tenant declines the offer or fails to respond within such
      period, the owner may commence an action or proceeding for the  eviction
      of such tenant.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 26-403.2
----------------

Section 26-403.2 ::    
        
     
        §  26-403.2  Increase in maximum collectable rent. Notwithstanding any
      provision of this law to the contrary in  the  case  where  all  tenants
      occupying  the  housing  accommodation  on  the  effective  date of this
      section have vacated the housing accommodation and a  family  member  of
      such  vacating  tenant or tenants is entitled to and continues to occupy
      the housing accommodation subject to the protections  of  this  law,  if
      such accommodation continues to be subject to this law after such family
      member   vacates,   on  the  occurrence  of  such  vacancy  the  maximum
      collectable rent shall be increased by a sum equal to the allowance then
      in effect for vacancy leases for housing accommodations covered  by  the
      rent  stabilization  law  of  nineteen hundred sixty-nine, including the
      amount allowed by paragraph five-a of subdivision c of section 26-511 of
      such law. This increase shall be in  addition  to  any  other  increases
      provided  for  in  this  law  including an adjustment based upon a major
      capital improvement, or a substantial increase or decrease  in  dwelling
      space  or  a change in the services, furniture, furnishings or equipment
      provided in the housing accommodation, pursuant  to  section  26-405  of
      this  law  and  shall  be  applicable  in  like  manner  to  each second
      subsequent succession.

      conduct through its own counsel any proceeding under this chapter of the
      code,  except  for the provisions of subdivision m of section 26-405 and

Section 26-405
--------------

Section 26-405 ::    
        
     
        §  26-405 General powers and duties of the city rent agency. a. (1) At
      the time this chapter shall become effective, the city rent agency shall
      establish maximum rents which, subject to the provisions of  subdivision
      b  of  this  section,  shall  be  the  maximum  rents in effect on April
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-two pursuant to the state rent act and
      the regulations thereunder.
        (2) (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of  this  subdivision,
      and  except  as  provided  in  subparagraph  (b)  of this paragraph two,
      effective August first, nineteen hundred seventy, the  maximum  rent  in
      effect  on July thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy shall be adjusted
      as follows:  (i) For any individual housing accommodation for which  one
      or  more  but  less  than two full fifteen per centum rent increases has
      been granted since May first, nineteen hundred fifty-three  pursuant  to
      former  subparagraph  (d)  of  paragraph  one  of  subdivision g of this
      section the maximum rent shall be increased by eight per centum.
        (ii) For any  individual  housing  accommodation  for  which  no  full
      fifteen  per  centum  rent  increase  has  been granted since May first,
      nineteen hundred fifty-three pursuant  to  former  subparagraph  (d)  of
      paragraph one of subdivision g of this section the maximum rent shall be
      increased  by  fifteen  per  centum,  except  that  if there was no such
      increase for any individual housing accommodation for which a first rent
      was established pursuant to former subdivision m of this  section  after
      July  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five and before August first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the maximum rent  shall  be  increased  by
      five  per  centum, and except that if there was no such increase for any
      individual housing accommodation for which a first rent was  established
      pursuant  to such subdivision on or after August first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-eight there shall be no increase in  maximum  rent.  On  or  after
      August  first, nineteen hundred seventy, a landlord may file application
      for labor cost rent adjustment pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph
      (1) of subdivision g of this section. In lieu of such  labor  cost  rent
      adjustment,  the  landlord  of  a  building with twenty or fewer housing
      accommodations shall have the option of filing for  a  five  per  centum
      increase  in  maximum  rent for any individual housing accommodation for
      which two or more full fifteen per centum increases  have  been  granted
      since  May  first,  nineteen  hundred  fifty-three  pursuant  to  former
      subparagraph (d) of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section.
        Nothing contained in this subparagraph (a)  however,  shall  have  the
      effect  of  establishing  the  maximum  rent  in an amount less than the
      maximum rent in effect on July thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy
      nor  of  increasing by more than fifteen per centum the maximum rent for
      any housing accommodation.
        (b) Where the maximum rent in effect on  July  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy  for  any individual housing accommodation is less than
      sixty dollars per month such rent shall be  increased  effective  August
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy  by  ten  dollars per month where the
      housing accommodation is comprised of three rooms or less and by fifteen
      dollars per month where the housing accommodation is comprised  of  more
      than three rooms.
        (c) Where a lease is in effect for any housing accommodation on August
      first,  nineteen hundred seventy, no adjustment of maximum rent for such
      accommodation shall become effective until the expiration of such lease.
      Where a housing accommodation becomes vacant on or after  August  first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy  and  before  January first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-two by voluntary surrender  of  possession  by  the  tenant  the
      maximum  rent shall be increased by no more than fifteen per centum over
      the maximum rent established for such  accommodation  at  the  time  the
      vacancy  occurred,  provided  that  a report is filed with the city rent
    
      agency as prescribed by its regulations. If the city rent  agency  shall
      make  a  finding  of harassment in violation of subdivision d of section
      26-412 of this chapter for the purpose of obtaining such a  vacancy,  in
      addition to all other civil or criminal penalties, injunctive relief and
      enforcement  remedies  authorized  by section 26-413 of this chapter, no
      housing accommodation in the building shall thereafter  be  entitled  to
      the  benefit of a rental increase as a result of becoming vacant between
      the aforesaid dates.
        (d) The total of (i) the increase pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this
      paragraph, or (ii) any increases granted between December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-nine and December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-one pursuant to subparagraph (a), (b), or (c) of  paragraph  one
      of  subdivision  g  of this section and (iii) any increase granted on or
      after the effective date of this paragraph pursuant to subparagraph  (l)
      of  paragraph  one  of  subdivision  g  of this section shall not exceed
      fifteen per centum of  the  "1970  base  rent".  For  purposes  of  this
      subparagraph,  the  "1970  base  rent"  is  the  maximum  rent  on  July
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy minus the amount of any  increase
      granted  between  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine and
      July thirty-first, nineteen hundred  seventy  pursuant  to  subparagraph
      (a), (b), or (c) of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section. This
      subparagraph  shall not operate to decrease any maximum rent existing on
      its effective date.
        (e) The rent increases provided for in this  paragraph  two  shall  be
      collectible  upon  the  landlord's  filing  a  report with the city rent
      agency on forms to be prescribed by such  agency,  including  simplified
      forms   for   landlords  of  buildings  with  twelve  or  fewer  housing
      accommodations, and giving such notice to the tenant as such agency  may
      prescribe, subject to adjustment upon order of the city rent agency. The
      report shall contain a certified statement by the landlord that there is
      no  legally  habitable  rent  controlled  housing  accommodation  in the
      building which has not been rented for a period of six months or more on
      the date of the filing of such report,  or  that  if  there  is  such  a
      housing  accommodation, the reasons it has not been rented is that it is
      being altered pursuant to a permit issued by the department of buildings
      no later than three months after the  vacancy  commenced  and  that  the
      alteration  is  of  such  a  nature  that the accommodation must be kept
      vacant while it is being made or for such other cause found by the  city
      rent  agency  not  to  be inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter,
      provided further that in the case  of  an  alteration  it  is  commenced
      within sixty days from the issuance of said permit. A copy of the permit
      and the application therefor shall accompany the report. No report shall
      be  accepted  for  filing  and  no  rent  increase  provided for in this
      paragraph two shall be collected in the absence of  any  such  certified
      statement  by  the landlord. Any excess shall be credited to the tenants
      in full commencing with the rental payment following the receipt by  the
      landlord  of  such  order  of  adjustment. If such report is filed on or
      before October thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy,  the  increase
      shall  take effect August first, nineteen hundred seventy. If the report
      is filed thereafter, such increase shall  take  effect  with  the  first
      rental payment following filing.
        (f) The rent increases provided for in this paragraph two shall not be
      collected  for  the  period between March thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      and seventy-one and December thirty-first, nineteen hundred  seventy-one
      until  the  landlord  shall  have  filed  with  the  city  rent agency a
      certified statement attesting that for every month for which he  or  she
      has  received  a  rent increase pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of
      this paragraph two, he or she has expended or incurred in the operation,
    
      maintenance and improvements of the housing  accommodations  from  which
      increases  were collected an amount which equals the amount expended per
      month for such purpose averaged over the preceding five years,  or  such
      lesser  period that he or she has been landlord of such properties, plus
      ninety per centum of all increased rents so collected.
        (3) The city rent agency shall establish maximum rents to be effective
      January first, nineteen hundred  seventy-two  by  dividing  the  maximum
      gross  building  rental  from all housing accommodations in the property
      whether or not subject to or exempt from control under this  chapter  by
      the  number  of  such accommodations, after giving consideration to such
      factors as may be prescribed by formula, such as size  and  location  of
      housing  accommodations and number of rooms. Such maximum gross building
      rental shall be computed on the basis of real estate taxes, water  rates
      and  sewer charges and an operation and maintenance expense allowance, a
      vacancy allowance not in excess of two per cent, and a  collection  loss
      allowance,  both as prescribed by such agency, and an eight and one-half
      per centum return  on  capital  value.  The  operating  and  maintenance
      expense  allowance  shall  include  provision  for  the  cost  of  fuel,
      utilities,  payroll,  maintenance  repairs,  replacement  reserves   and
      miscellaneous  charges  attributed  to  the property, excluding mortgage
      interest and amortization, and may be varied by the agency for different
      types  of  properties  depending  upon  such  factors  as  the  year  of
      construction, elevator or non-elevator buildings, and the average number
      of  rooms per individual housing accommodations in the building. Capital
      value shall be equalized assessed valuation based upon  the  appropriate
      tax  class  ratio which is established pursuant to article twelve of the
      real property tax law. Where the property receives income  from  sources
      other  than  such  housing  accommodations,  the  taxes, water and sewer
      charges and the capital value attributed to the  portion  consisting  of
      housing  accommodations  shall  be in the same ratio of the total taxes,
      water and sewer charges (where not computed separately)  and  the  total
      capital  value  as  the  gross  income  from  such portion consisting of
      housing  accommodations  bears  to  the  total  gross  income  from  the
      property, as prescribed by the agency.
        The agency shall report to the council on or before October fifteenth,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-one  as  to  the status of preparation of the
      formulas necessary to implement the rent  adjustments  to  be  effective
      January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two.
        (4)  The  city  rent  agency  shall  establish maximum rents effective
      January first, nineteen hundred seventy-four and  biennially  thereafter
      by  adjusting  the  existing maximum rent to reflect changes, if any, in
      the  factors  which  determine  maximum  gross  building  rental   under
      paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision  except  that commencing January
      first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, said maximum rent  shall  no  longer
      recognize  or  reflect  the  adjustment  allocable to changes in heating
      costs after April ninth, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.
        Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  in  this  paragraph  to   the
      contrary,  commencing  January first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, the
      city rent  agency  shall  require  each  owner  to  make  available  for
      examination his or her books and all other financial records relating to
      the  operation  of  each  building under his or her ownership containing
      accommodations subject to this chapter at least once every  three  years
      for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  the maximum formula rent is
      appropriate for each building in light of actual  expenditures  therefor
      and  shall also alter such formula rent to take into account significant
      variations between the formula and actual cost  experience.  The  agency
      shall also establish maximum costs for the factors under paragraph three
      of  this  subdivision  which  determine maximum gross building rental to
    
      preclude  increases  which  would  otherwise  results   from   excessive
      expenditures  in  the  operation  and  maintenance  of the building. The
      return allowed on capital may be revised from time to time by local law.
        (5)  Where  a  maximum rent established pursuant to this chapter on or
      after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, is  higher  than  the
      previously existing maximum rent, the landlord may not collect more than
      seven and one-half percentum increase from a tenant in occupancy on such
      date in any one year period, provided however, that where the period for
      which  the  rent  is established exceeds one year, regardless of how the
      collection thereof is averaged over such period, the rent  the  landlord
      shall be entitled to receive during the first twelve months shall not be
      increased  by  more  than seven and one-half percentum over the previous
      rent and additional annual rents shall not  exceed  seven  and  one-half
      percentum of the rent paid during the previous year. Notwithstanding any
      of  the foregoing limitations in this paragraph five, maximum rent shall
      be increased if ordered by the agency  pursuant  to  subparagraphs  (d),
      (e),  (f),  (g),  (h),  (i),  (k),  (l),  (m) or (n) of paragraph one of
      subdivision g  of  this  section.  Commencing  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty,  rent  adjustments  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (n)  of
      paragraph one of subdivision g of this section shall  be  excluded  from
      the  maximum  rent  when  computing  the  seven  and  one-half percentum
      increase  authorized  by  this   paragraph   five.   Where   a   housing
      accommodation  is vacant on January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two,
      or becomes vacant thereafter by voluntary surrender of possession by the
      tenants, the maximum rent established for  such  accommodations  may  be
      collected.
        (6)  Where  a new maximum rent has been established pursuant to former
      subdivision  m  of  this  section  or,  following  the  repeal  of  such
      subdivision,   pursuant   to   subparagraph  (m)  of  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision g  of  this  section,  a  new  maximum  rent  shall  not  be
      established pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision. Except with
      respect  to  a  housing  accommodation  to  which the preceding sentence
      applies, where the  maximum  rent  on  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred seventy-one is higher than the maximum rent established pursuant
      to  paragraph  three  of this subdivision, such prior maximum rent shall
      continue in effect until the maximum  rent  under  paragraph  three,  as
      adjusted  from  time to time pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
      shall equal or exceed such prior maximum rent, at which time the maximum
      rent for such housing accommodations shall  be  as  prescribed  in  this
      chapter.
        (7) Section eight housing assistance.
        (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, if during a rental
      period  in  which  the  landlord  is  eligible  for  an  adjustment   or
      establishment  of  rents  pursuant  to  paragraph  three or four of this
      subdivision, housing assistance payments  are  being  made  pursuant  to
      section  eight  of  the  United  States  housing act of nineteen hundred
      thirty-seven, as amended, with  respect  to  any  housing  accommodation
      covered by this chapter, the maximum rent collectible from the tenant in
      occupancy shall be the lesser of:
        (1)  the  maximum rent established pursuant to paragraph three of this
      subdivision as adjusted  pursuant  to  this  chapter,  computed  without
      regard  to  the  limitations  of  paragraph  five  of  this  subdivision
      (provided that in any case the rent paid by the tenant pursuant to  this
      chapter  without  regard to this paragraph is higher than such rent, the
      rent paid shall be substituted for such rent), or
        (2) the  contract  or  fair  market  rent  approved  for  the  housing
      accommodation pursuant to federal law or regulation.
    
        (b)  Prior  to the collection of any increase in maximum rent pursuant
      to this paragraph, the landlord shall advise the city rent agency of his
      or her intent to compute the maximum rent pursuant to this paragraph.
        (c)  If  a  housing  accommodation  to  which this subdivision applies
      ceases for any reason to be governed by this paragraph, the maximum rent
      collectible from the tenant shall be computed as if this  paragraph  had
      not  applied and any adjustments thereto which would have been permitted
      pursuant to this chapter during the period such rent  was  set  by  this
      paragraph shall be proper rental adjustments.
        (8)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of this chapter, upon the sale in
      any manner authorized by law of a multiple dwelling which was previously
      subject to the provisions of such chapter and which was acquired by  the
      city  in  a tax foreclosure proceeding or pursuant to article nineteen-A
      of the real property actions and proceedings law, for  a  dwelling  unit
      which  was  subject  to  this  chapter  pursuant  to the local emergency
      housing rent control act at the time the  city  so  acquired  title,  is
      occupied by a tenant who was in occupancy at the time of acquisition and
      remains  in occupancy at the time of sale, the maximum rent shall be the
      last rent charged by the city, or  on  behalf  of  the  city,  for  such
      dwelling unit, which rent shall not exceed the rent computed pursuant to
      paragraph  three  of  this  subdivision, computed as of the time of such
      sale. This paragraph shall not apply to redemptions from city  ownership
      pursuant to chapter four of title eleven of the code.
        (9)  The  city  rent  agency, prior to establishing biennially maximum
      base rents pursuant to this chapter and before  establishing  a  maximum
      base  rent  which is different from the previously existing maximum base
      rent for dwellings covered by this law, shall hold a public  hearing  or
      hearings  for the purpose of collecting information the city rent agency
      may consider in establishing maximum base rents.  Notice  of  the  date,
      time,  location  and summary of subject matter for the public hearing or
      hearings shall be published in the City Record for a period of not  less
      than  fourteen  days,  and  at  least  once in one or more newspapers of
      general circulation at least fourteen days  immediately  preceding  each
      hearing  date,  at  the expense of the city of New York, and the hearing
      shall be open for testimony from any individual, group,  association  or
      representative thereof who wants to testify.
        b.  Such  agency,  to  effectuate the purposes of this chapter, and in
      accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph two of  subdivision
      c  of this section, may set aside and correct any maximum rent resulting
      from illegality, irregularity in vital matters or fraud, occurring prior
      to or after May first, nineteen hundred sixty-two.
        c. (1) Whenever such agency determines that such action  is  necessary
      to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  it may also establish
      maximum rents for housing accommodations to which this chapter  applies,
      where  no  maximum  rent  with  respect  thereto  was in effect on April
      thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-two,  or  where   no   registration
      statement  had  been filed with respect thereto as required by the state
      rent act, or where for any other reason the provisions of subdivision  a
      of  this  section are not susceptible to application to any such housing
      accommodations.
        (2) Such rents shall be established, having  regard  for  the  maximum
      rents for comparable housing accommodations or any other factors bearing
      on the equities involved, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
        d. Where any housing accommodations, which are decontrolled (including
      those  decontrolled  by  order) or exempted from control pursuant to the
      provisions of subparagraph (i) of paragraph  two  of  subdivision  e  of
      section  26-403 of this chapter, are certified by any city agency having
      jurisdiction to be a fire hazard or in a continued  dangerous  condition
    
      or  detrimental  to life or health, the city rent agency shall establish
      maximum rents for such housing accommodations,  having  regard  for  the
      maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations or any other factors
      bearing  on  the equities involved, consistent with the purposes of this
      chapter.
        e. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and subject to
      the provisions of subdivision f of this section, provision shall be made
      pursuant to regulations prescribed by  the  city  rent  agency  for  the
      establishment, adjustment and modification of maximum rents with respect
      to  rooming  house and single room occupancy accommodations, which shall
      include those housing accommodations subject to control pursuant to  the
      provisions  of  subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph two of subdivision e of
      section 26-403 of this chapter (other than those accommodations  subject
      to  control  under  the  last  proviso of such subparagraph (c)), having
      regard for any factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with
      the purposes of this  chapter,  to  correct  speculative,  abnormal  and
      unwarranted increases in rent.
        f.  On  or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-two, the city
      rent agency shall undertake a survey and investigation  of  all  factors
      affecting  rents, rental conditions and rental practices with respect to
      rooming houses and single room occupancy accommodations within the  city
      for  the  purpose  of determining whether the provisions of this chapter
      and  the  regulations  thereunder  relating  to  the  establishment  and
      adjustment  of maximum rents for rooming house and single room occupancy
      accommodations  are  reasonably  designed   to   prevent   exaction   of
      unreasonable  and  oppressive  rents.  Not later than January fifteenth,
      nineteen hundred sixty-three, such agency shall submit to the council  a
      report  setting  forth  the  results  of  such survey and investigation,
      together with the findings and recommendations of such  agency  and  any
      amendments  to  this  chapter  and the regulations thereunder which such
      agency may deem necessary or desirable for  the  accomplishment  of  the
      purposes  of this chapter in relation to such accommodations. During the
      period between May first, nineteen hundred sixty-two and  the  thirtieth
      day  next  succeeding  the  date of the submission of such report to the
      council (1) no application for an increase in any maximum rent  for  any
      rooming  house  or  single room occupancy accommodations may be filed on
      any ground other than those specified in subparagraphs (f)  and  (g)  of
      paragraph one of subdivision g of this section, and (2) no maximum rents
      for  any  rooming house or single room occupancy accommodations shall be
      increased  on  any  grounds  other  than   those   specified   in   such
      subparagraphs (f) and (g); provided that where the maximum rents for any
      such accommodations were or are decreased prior to or during such period
      because of the landlord's reduction of living space, essential services,
      furniture,  furnishings  or  equipment,  and  such  reduction  has  been
      corrected, an application for restoration of the rent  decrease  may  be
      filed  and  such  rents may be adjusted so as to fix maximum rents which
      the city rent agency  may  determine  to  be  proper,  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of subdivision e of this section, but which shall not in any
      event exceed  the  maximum  rents  for  such  accommodations  in  effect
      immediately prior to such rent decrease.
        g.  (1)  The city rent agency may from time to time adopt, promulgate,
      amend or rescind such rules, regulations  and  orders  as  it  may  deem
      necessary  or  proper  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,
      including practices relating to recovery of  possession;  provided  that
      such  regulations  can  be  put into effect without general uncertainty,
      dislocation and hardship inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter;
      and provided further that such regulations shall be designed to maintain
      a system of rent controls at levels  which,  in  the  judgment  of  such
    
      agency,  are  generally fair and equitable and which will provide for an
      orderly transition from and termination of  emergency  controls  without
      undue  dislocations,  inflationary  price rises or disruption. Provision
      shall  be  made,  pursuant to regulations prescribed by such agency, for
      individual adjustment of maximum rents where:
        (a) The rental income from a property yields a net  annual  return  of
      less than six per centum of the valuation of the property.
        (1) Such valuation shall be the current assessed valuation established
      by  the  city,  which  is  in  effect  at  the time of the filing of the
      application for an adjustment  under  this  subparagraph  (a);  provided
      that:
        (i)  The  city rent agency may make a determination that the valuation
      of the property is an amount  different  from  such  assessed  valuation
      where  there has been a reduction in the assessed valuation for the year
      next preceding the effective date of the current assessed  valuation  in
      effect at the time of the filing of the application; and
        (ii)  Such  agency  may  make  a  determination  that the value of the
      property is an amount different from the assessed valuation where  there
      has  been  a  bona  fide sale of the property within the period February
      first, nineteen hundred  sixty-one,  and  the  time  of  filing  of  the
      application,  as  the result of a transaction at arm's length, on normal
      financing terms, at a readily ascertainable  price,  and  unaffected  by
      special circumstances such as but not limited to a forced sale, exchange
      of property, package deal, wash sale or sale to a cooperative; provided,
      however, that where an application was filed under this subparagraph (a)
      on  or  before  the  effective date of this sub-item (ii), the city rent
      agency may determine the value of the property on the basis  that  there
      has  been  a  bona  fide  sale of the property within the period between
      March fifteenth, nineteen hundred  fifty-eight,  and  the  time  of  the
      filing  of  the application. In determining whether a sale was on normal
      financing terms,  such  agency  shall  give  due  consideration  to  the
      following factors:
        (a)  the  ratio  of the cash payment received by the seller to (1) the
      sales price of the property and (2) the annual  gross  income  from  the
      property;
        (b)  the  total  amount  of  the outstanding mortgages which are liens
      against the property (including purchase money  mortgages)  as  compared
      with the assessed valuation of the property;
        (c)  the  ratio  of  the sales price to the annual gross income of the
      property,  with  consideration  given  to  the  total  amount  of   rent
      adjustments previously granted, exclusive of rent adjustments because of
      changes   in   dwelling   space,  services,  furniture,  furnishings  or
      equipment, major capital improvements, or substantial rehabilitation;
        (d) the presence of deferred amortization in purchase money mortgages,
      or the assignment of such mortgage at a discount;
        (e) Any other facts and circumstances surrounding such sale which,  in
      the  judgment  of  such  agency, may have a bearing upon the question of
      financing; and
        (iii) Where the assessed valuation of the land exceeds four times  the
      assessed  valuation  of  the buildings thereon, the city rent agency may
      determine a valuation of the property equal to five times  the  assessed
      valuation of the buildings, for the purposes of this subparagraph (a).
        (2)  An  application  for  an  increase in any maximum rent under this
      subparagraph (a) of this paragraph one may not be filed with respect  to
      any property if, on the date when the application is sought to be filed:
        (i)  Less  than two years have elapsed since the date of the filing of
      the last prior application for an increase under this  subparagraph  (a)
    
      of  this  paragraph one with respect to such property, which application
      resulted in the granting of an increase; or
        (ii)  Less  than  two  years  have  elapsed since the last sale of the
      property, and the application is based upon a sale price  in  excess  of
      the  assessed  valuation.  This  subitem shall not apply, however, where
      less than two years have elapsed since the last sale of the property and
      the application is based upon a sale within such two-year  period  at  a
      price  in  excess  of the assessed valuation, if such price is less than
      the price in the last sale which meets the criteria heretofore specified
      in this subparagraph  (a)  occurring  prior  to  two  years  before  the
      application  is  sought  to  be filed and since February first, nineteen
      hundred sixty-one.
        (3)  No  increase  in  maximum  rents  shall  be  granted  under  this
      subparagraph  (a) by the city rent agency while there is pending without
      final  disposition  any  judicial  proceeding  to  correct   the   final
      determination  of  the  tax  commission  with  respect  to  the assessed
      valuation of such property, (a) for the city fiscal year  in  which  the
      landlord  filed  the  application  for such increase or (b) for the city
      fiscal year immediately preceding the filing of the application for such
      increase.
        (4) For the purposes of this subparagraph (a): (i) Net  annual  return
      shall  be  the  amount  by which the earned income exceeds the operating
      expenses of the property, excluding mortgage interest and  amortization,
      and excluding allowances for obsolescence and reserves, but including an
      allowance  for  depreciation  of  two  per  centum  of  the value of the
      buildings exclusive of the land, or the amount shown for depreciation of
      the  buildings  in  the  latest  required  federal  income  tax  return,
      whichever   is   lower;   provided,   however,  that  no  allowance  for
      depreciation of the buildings shall be included where the buildings have
      been fully depreciated for federal income tax purposes or on  the  books
      of the owner; and
        (ii)  Test  year  shall  be  the most recent full calendar year or the
      landlord's most recent fiscal year  or  any  twelve  consecutive  months
      ending  not more than ninety days prior to the filing of the application
      for an increase;
        (b) Where a building contains no more than nineteen rental  units  and
      the  landlord  has  not  been  fully  compensated by increases in rental
      income sufficient to offset unavoidable  increases  in  property  taxes,
      fuel,  utilities,  insurance  and  repairs  and  maintenance,  excluding
      mortgage  interest  and  amortization,  and  excluding   allowance   for
      depreciation,  obsolescence  and reserves, which have occurred since the
      federal date determining the maximum rent; or
        (c) The  landlord  operates  a  hotel  or  rooming  house  or  owns  a
      cooperative apartment and has not been fully compensated by increases in
      rental  income  from the controlled housing accommodations sufficient to
      offset such unavoidable increases in property taxes and other  costs  as
      are allocable to such controlled housing accommodations, including costs
      of  operation  of  such  hotel  or rooming house, but excluding mortgage
      interest and amortization, and excluding  allowances  for  depreciation,
      obsolescence  and  reserves,  which have occurred since the federal date
      determining the maximum rent or the  date  the  landlord  commenced  the
      operation of the property, whichever is later; or
        (d)  The  landlord  and  tenant  in occupancy voluntarily enter into a
      valid  written  lease  in  good  faith  with  respect  to  any   housing
      accommodation,  which lease provides for an increase in the maximum rent
      on the basis of specified increased services, furniture, furnishings, or
      equipment, provided the city rent agency determines that  the  specified
      increased  services,  furniture,  furnishings or equipment have a market
    
      value commensurate with the increased rent, the increase maximum rent is
      not in excess of fifteen per centum and the lease is for a term  of  not
      less than two years, provided further that a report of lease is filed as
      prescribed  by  regulations  issued  by the city rent agency or has been
      otherwise accepted by such agency, and provided further, that where  the
      entire  structure, or any lesser portion thereof was vacated by order of
      a  city  department  having   jurisdiction,   on   or   after   November
      twenty-second, nineteen hundred sixty-three and any tenants therein were
      relocated by the department of relocation, or such structure was boarded
      up   by   the  department  of  real  estate,  such  lease  increases  in
      subsequently executed leases shall not become effective for any  housing
      accommodations  in  the  structure  until  such  departments  have  been
      reimbursed for expenses necessarily  incurred  in  connection  with  the
      foregoing;  provided further, however, that the landlord may obtain such
      lease increases without making such reimbursement where the vacating was
      caused by fire or accident  not  resulting  from  any  unlawful  act  or
      omission on the part of the landlord; or
        (e)  The  landlord  and  tenant  by mutual voluntary written agreement
      agree to a substantial increase or  decrease  in  dwelling  space  or  a
      change  in the services, furniture, furnishings or equipment provided in
      the housing accommodations. An adjustment under this subparagraph  shall
      be  equal to one-fortieth, in the case of a building with thirty-five or
      fewer housing accommodations, or one-sixtieth, in the case of a building
      with more than thirty-five housing accommodations where such  adjustment
      takes  effect  on or after September twenty-fourth, two thousand eleven,
      of  the  total  cost  incurred  by  the  landlord  in   providing   such
      modification   or  increase  in  dwelling  space,  services,  furniture,
      furnishings or  equipment,  including  the  cost  of  installation,  but
      excluding  finance  charges,  provided  further  that  an  owner  who is
      entitled to a rent increase pursuant to this subparagraph shall  not  be
      entitled  to  a  further  rent  increase  based upon the installation of
      similar equipment, or new furniture or  furnishings  within  the  useful
      life  of  such new equipment, or new furniture or furnishings. The owner
      shall give written notice to the city rent agency of any such adjustment
      pursuant to this subparagraph; or
        (f) There has been since March first, nineteen hundred fifty-nine,  an
      increase  in  the rental value of the housing accommodations as a result
      of a substantial rehabilitation of the building or housing accommodation
      therein  which  materially  adds  to  the  value  of  the  property   or
      appreciably  prolongs  its life, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance
      and replacements; or
        (g) There has been since July first, nineteen hundred seventy, a major
      capital  improvement  required  for  the  operation,   preservation   or
      maintenance  of the structure. An adjustment under this subparagraph (g)
      shall  be  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  amortize  the  cost  of   the
      improvements pursuant to this subparagraph (g) over a seven-year period;
      or
        (h) There have been since March first, nineteen hundred fifty-nine, in
      structures  containing  more  than  four  housing  accommodations, other
      improvements made with the express consent of the tenants  in  occupancy
      of  at  least  seventy-five  per  centum  of the housing accommodations;
      provided, however, that whenever the city  rent  agency  has  determined
      that  the improvements proposed were part of a plan designed for overall
      improvement of the structure or increases in services, it may  authorize
      increases  in maximum rents for all housing accommodations affected upon
      the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of  at  least  fifty-one
      per  centum  of the housing accommodations, and provided further that no
      adjustment granted hereunder shall exceed fifteen per centum unless  the
    
      tenants  have  agreed  to  a  higher  percentage  of increase, as herein
      provided; or
        (i)  There has been, since March first, nineteen hundred fifty-nine, a
      subletting without written consent from the landlord or an  increase  in
      the  number  of  adult  occupants  who  are not members of the immediate
      family of the tenant, and the landlord has not been compensated therefor
      by adjustment of the maximum rent by lease or order  of  the  city  rent
      agency or pursuant to the state rent act or the federal act; or
        (j)  The  presence  of  unique  or  peculiar  circumstances materially
      affecting the maximum rent has resulted  in  a  maximum  rent  which  is
      substantially lower than the rents generally prevailing in the same area
      for substantially similar housing accommodations.
        (k)  The  landlord has incurred, since January first, nineteen hundred
      seventy, in connection with  and  in  addition  to  a  concurrent  major
      capital  improvement  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (g) of this paragraph,
      other expenditures to improve, restore or preserve the  quality  of  the
      structure.  An  adjustment under this subparagraph shall be granted only
      if such improvements represent an expenditure equal to at least ten  per
      centum of the total operating and maintenance expenses for the preceding
      year.  An adjustment under this subparagraph shall be in addition to any
      adjustment granted for the  concurrent  major  capital  improvement  and
      shall   be  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  amortize  the  cost  of  the
      improvements pursuant to this subparagraph over a seven-year period.
        (l) (1) The actual labor expenses currently incurred or to be incurred
      (pursuant to a collective agreement or other obligation actually entered
      into by the landlord) exceed the provision for payroll expenses  in  the
      current  applicable  operating  and  maintenance expense allowance under
      subdivision  a  of  this  section.  No  application  pursuant  to   this
      subparagraph  may  be  granted  within  one year from the granting of an
      adjustment in  maximum  rent  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  (l),  or
      pursuant  to  subparagraph  (a) of this paragraph. Any rent increase the
      applicant would be entitled to,  or  such  portion  thereof,  shall  not
      exceed  a  total  increase of seven and one-half per centum per annum of
      the maximum rent as provided in paragraph five of subdivision a of  this
      section.
        (2)  Any  adjustment  in  the  maximum  rents pursuant hereto shall be
      subject to:
        (i) The adjustment in maximum rent for any twelve-month period for any
      housing accommodation shall not exceed four percent of the maximum  rent
      in effect on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-three.
        (ii)  Where  the  increase  in  labor  costs compensable herein is the
      result of an industry-wide collective bargaining agreement or a specific
      agreement  in  anticipation  of,  or  subsequent  to,  an  industry-wide
      collective  bargaining agreement, the adjustment shall be in such amount
      (subject to the above limitation) that the increased rental income  from
      January  first,  nineteen hundred seventy-four to December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-six shall reflect the increased labor costs for
      the period from April thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-three to April
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-six.
        (3) For the purpose of this subparagraph (l)  the  increase  in  labor
      costs  shall  be  the  amount  by  which the labor costs (a) actually in
      effect and paid, or (b) actually in effect and paid or payable and fixed
      and determined pursuant to agreement on the date of the  filing  of  the
      application  and  projected  over  the  period  ending  April thirtieth,
      nineteen hundred seventy-six, exceed the  labor  costs  for  the  twelve
      calendar months immediately preceding the last day of the month in which
      the wage agreement became effective.
    
        (4)   Notwithstanding   any  other  provision  of  this  chapter,  the
      adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph shall be collectible  upon  the
      landlord's  filing of a report with the city rent agency, subject to the
      provisions of subparagraph (e) of paragraph two of subdivision a of this
      section.
        (5)  No increase in the maximum rent for any housing accommodation may
      be granted  under  this  subparagraph  (l)  if  on  the  date  when  the
      application  is  sought  to  be  filed,  less than the full term of such
      agreement has elapsed since the date of the filing  of  the  last  prior
      application  for  an  increase  with respect to such property under this
      subparagraph (l), which application  resulted  in  the  granting  of  an
      increase.  Where,  however,  the  landlord  establishes the existence of
      unique or peculiar circumstances affecting an increase  in  labor  costs
      for  the  property,  the  agency  may  accept  such application where it
      determines that such acceptance is not inconsistent with the purposes of
      this local law.
        (6) The increase authorized  herein  shall  be  apportioned  equitably
      among  all  the  housing  accommodations  in the property whether or not
      subject to control under this chapter.
        (m)  Where  the  rehabilitation  or  improvement  of  sub-standard  or
      deteriorated   housing   accommodations   has   been  financed  under  a
      governmental program providing assistance through loans, loan  insurance
      or  tax  abatement  or  has been undertaken under another rehabilitation
      program not so financed but approved by the commissioner.
        (n)(1) The city rent agency shall hereafter promulgate in  January  of
      each year;
        (i)  findings  regarding the price increase or decrease, respectively,
      for all types of heating fuel, including numbers two, four and six  home
      heating  oils,  utility  supplied  steam,  gas,  electricity  and  coal,
      together  with  the  sales  and  excise  taxes  thereon,   on   December
      thirty-first as compared to the January first in any year; and
        (ii) standards for consumption of heating fuel, which shall be no more
      than  two  hundred  twenty-five  gallons  per  year  per room commencing
      January first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, for buildings using  heating
      oils  for heat with comparable unit limitations to be established by the
      city rent agency for utility supplied steam, gas, electricity, coal  and
      any  other  types  of  heating  systems,  provided that such consumption
      standards for heating fuels shall be reduced by five  gallons  per  room
      per  year  for  heating  oils  and a comparable amount for other heating
      fuels for the next succeeding year and ten gallons per room per year for
      heating oils and a comparable amount for other  heating  fuels  for  two
      succeeding years thereafter.
        Such findings and consumption standards shall be published in the City
      Record.
        (2)  To  obtain a rental adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n),
      the landlord shall file a report with the agency on forms prescribed  by
      the agency and shall:
        (i)  certify  the amount of heating fuel consumed in the calendar year
      immediately prior to the filing of the report;
        (ii) state the type of fuel used  and  the  number  of  rooms  in  the
      building;
        (iii)  certify that (a) all essential services required to be provided
      have been and will continue to be maintained and (b) there has  been  no
      rent  reduction  order  issued  pursuant  to  this  chapter based on the
      landlord's failure to provide heat or hot water during the prior  twelve
      months;
        (iv)  certify  on  information  and belief, in order to qualify for an
      additional rent increase pursuant to this subparagraph (n), that for  an
    
      individual  housing  accommodation,  if  the  maximum  rent  collectible
      pursuant to paragraph five of subdivision a of this section plus  actual
      rent  adjustments  pursuant to this subparagraph (n) and such additional
      rent  increase,  is  equal  to  or  exceeds the maximum rent established
      pursuant to paragraphs three and four of subdivision a of  this  section
      plus  the  amount  calculated  pursuant to subitem (i) of item three and
      subitem (i) of item four of this subparagraph (n), each to be  allocated
      to  such  housing accommodation pursuant to subitem (ii) of item four of
      this subparagraph (n), that the landlord will not be earning  an  amount
      in  excess  of  the  statutory  return  specified in subparagraph (a) of
      paragraph one of subdivision g of this section  after  collection  of  a
      rent  increase  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  (n), with respect to a
      building or buildings serviced by a single heating plant;
        (v)  report  any  funds  received  with   respect   to   the   housing
      accommodations  from  any  governmental  grant program compensating such
      landlord for fuel  price  increases  during  the  period  for  which  an
      adjustment is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph (n);
        (vi) provide such other information as the agency may require.
        (3)  Rent adjustments for controlled housing accommodations for annual
      heating fuel cost increases  or  decreases  experienced  after  December
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine,  shall  be determined as
      follows:
        (i) the increase or decrease in  heating  fuel  prices  found  by  the
      agency  for that year shall be multiplied by the actual consumption, not
      to exceed that  year's  consumption  standard  established  pursuant  to
      subitem (ii) of item one of this subparagraph; and
        (ii)  seventy-five  percentum  of such amount shall be allocated among
      all rental space in the building, including commercial, professional and
      similar facilities, provided, for the purposes of this subparagraph (n),
      that living rooms, kitchens over fifty-nine  square  feet  in  area  and
      bedrooms  shall  be  considered  rooms  and  that  bathrooms, foyers and
      kitchenettes shall not be considered rooms.
        (4) Rent adjustments for controlled housing accommodations for heating
      fuel cost increases or decreases experienced from April ninth,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-nine,  through  and  including  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-nine, shall be determined as follows:
        (i) the increase or decrease in  heating  fuel  prices  found  by  the
      agency  for that period shall be multiplied by seventy-five percentum of
      the actual heating fuel  consumption  during  the  period  from  January
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine,  through and including December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, which consumption shall not
      exceed  seventy-five  percentum  of  that  year's  consumption  standard
      established by the agency; and
        (ii)  such  amount  shall  be  allocated among all rental space in the
      building, including commercial,  professional  and  similar  facilities,
      provided,  for the purposes of this subparagraph (n), that living rooms,
      kitchens over fifty-nine square feet  in  area  and  bedrooms  shall  be
      considered  rooms  and that bathrooms, foyers and kitchenettes shall not
      be considered rooms.
        The city rent agency shall promulgate findings for heating fuel  price
      increases or decreases and standards for consumption for the periods set
      forth in this item four thirty days after this local law is enacted. The
      standard for consumption shall be no more than seventy-five percentum of
      two hundred thirty gallons per room for buildings using heating oils for
      heat with comparable unit limitations to be established by the city rent
      agency  for utility supplied steam, gas, electricity, coal and any other
      types of heating systems.
    
        (5) A landlord who files a report pursuant to  this  subparagraph  and
      who  falsely  certifies  shall  not  be  eligible  to  collect  any rent
      adjustment pursuant to this  subparagraph  for  two  years  following  a
      determination of a false certification and, in addition, any adjustments
      obtained pursuant to this subparagraph for up to two years prior to such
      determination  shall  not  be collectible for that same two year period.
      Such landlord shall also be subject to any additional penalties  imposed
      by law.
        (6)   A   landlord  annually  may  file  a  report  pursuant  to  this
      subparagraph (n) after promulgation by the agency of  the  findings  and
      consumption  standards set forth in item one of subparagraph (n). A rent
      adjustment pursuant to such report shall  be  prospectively  collectible
      upon  the  landlord's  serving and filing the report, provided, however,
      that  if  a  landlord  files  such  report  within  sixty  days  of  the
      promulgation  of  such  findings  and  consumption  standards, such rent
      adjustment shall be retroactive to and shall  be  effective  as  of  the
      January first of the year in which the report is filed.
        (7)  A  landlord demanding or collecting a rent adjustment pursuant to
      this subparagraph (n)  shall  at  the  time  of  either  the  demand  or
      collection  issue to the tenant either a rent bill or receipt separately
      setting forth the amount of the adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph
      (n) and the amount of the maximum rent otherwise demanded or  collected.
      If  the  tenant  has  been  issued a valid senior citizen rent exemption
      order or a valid disability rent exemption order, the owner  shall  also
      separately state the amount payable by the senior citizen or person with
      a disability after the exemption.
        (8)  In  the  event  that a rent reduction order is issued by the city
      rent agency based upon the landlord's failure to  provide  heat  or  hot
      water  to  housing accommodations for which the landlord is collecting a
      rent adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n), the  rent  adjustment
      shall  not  be collected during the time such rent reduction order is in
      effect and for twelve months following the date of  the  restoration  of
      the  rent  reduction. In addition, the landlord shall not be eligible to
      collect any subsequent rent adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n)
      until twelve months following the date of the restoration  of  the  rent
      reduction.
        (9)  In the event that the city rent agency promulgates a finding of a
      price decrease, if any landlord  who  has  obtained  a  rent  adjustment
      pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  (n)  does not file a report for a rent
      adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (n) within sixty  days  of  the
      promulgation  of  such  findings,  then  all  rent  adjustments obtained
      pursuant to this subparagraph (n) shall not be collectible for a  period
      of twelve months.
        (10)  Any  rent  adjustment obtained pursuant to this subparagraph (n)
      shall not be included  in  the  maximum  rent  established  pursuant  to
      paragraph four or five of subdivision (a) of this section.
        (11)  The  city  rent  agency  shall have the power to promulgate such
      regulations as it may consider necessary or convenient to implement  and
      administer  the  provisions  of  this  subparagraph (n). The regulations
      shall also require that any rent adjustment  granted  pursuant  to  this
      subparagraph (n) be reduced by an amount equal to any governmental grant
      received  by  the  landlord compensating the landlord for any fuel price
      increases, but not required by the city,  the  agency  or  any  granting
      government   entity   to   be  expended  for  fuel  related  repairs  or
      improvements.
        (o) (1) There has  been  an  increase  in  heating  and  heating  fuel
      expenditures  in  a  property resulting from a city-wide rise in heating
      fuel costs such that the verifiable expenditures for heating or  heating
    
      fuel  in  a  property  for  nineteen  hundred  seventy-four  exceeds the
      verifiable expenditures for such heating or heating fuel during nineteen
      hundred seventy-three.
        (2)  To  obtain a rental adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (o),
      the landlord must certify that he or she is  presently  maintaining  all
      essential  services required to be furnished with respect to the housing
      accommodations covered by such certification, and that he  or  she  will
      continue  to  so  maintain such essential services for the period of any
      such adjustment.
        (3) To obtain a rental adjustment pursuant to this  subparagraph  (o),
      the  landlord must certify on information and belief that he or she will
      not be earning an amount in excess of the statutory return specified  in
      subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section after
      collection  of  such  rental adjustment, with respect to the building or
      buildings serviced by a single heating plant; and where the building, or
      buildings serviced by a single heating  plant,  contains  forty-nine  or
      fewer  housing accommodations, the landlord must certify that the amount
      expended directly for  heating  or  heating  fuel  in  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four  equalled  or  exceeded  ten  per  cent of the total rental
      income which was derived  from  the  property  during  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-four; and, where the building, or buildings serviced by a single
      heating  plant,  contains  fifty  or  more  housing  accommodations  the
      landlord must certify that the amount expended directly for  heating  or
      heating fuel in nineteen hundred seventy-four equalled or exceeded seven
      and one-half percentum of the total rental income which was derived from
      the property during nineteen hundred seventy-four.
        (4)  The  total  rental  adjustments for a property to be allocated or
      deemed allocated pursuant to this  subparagraph  (o)  shall  not  exceed
      one-half  of the gross amount by which the total verifiable expenditures
      for heating or heating fuel for nineteen  hundred  seventy-four  exceeds
      the  total  verifiable expenditures for such heating or heating fuel for
      nineteen hundred seventy-three.
        (5) Such  total  rental  adjustments  shall  be  allocated  or  deemed
      allocated   pursuant   to   this   subparagraph   (o)   to  all  housing
      accommodations  subject  to  this  chapter,   to   all   other   housing
      accommodations,   and   to  all  commercial,  professional  and  similar
      facilities in or  associated  with  the  property  in  a  manner  to  be
      determined  by  the  agency. In no event shall any adjustment in maximum
      rent pursuant to this subparagraph (o) for  any  housing  accommodations
      subject  to  this  chapter  exceed a monthly increase of two dollars per
      room, as defined by item eight below. In any apartment  containing  five
      or more rooms, any increase shall not exceed the total of nine dollars.
        (6)  Any  adjustment  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  (o)  shall  be
      effective for all or part of the period  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-five  through  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-six. Any
      adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph shall automatically  expire  no
      later than June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-six.
        (7)  The  rental  increases provided for herein shall be effective and
      collectible upon the landlord's filing a report with the agency on forms
      prescribed by the agency and upon giving such notice to the  tenants  as
      the  agency  shall  prescribe,  subject to adjustments upon order of the
      agency.
        (8) In determining the  amount  of  an  adjustment  allocation  of  an
      adjustment  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph  (o),  only  living  rooms,
      kitchens over fifty-nine square feet in area, dining rooms and  bedrooms
      shall be considered rooms; bathrooms, foyers, and kitchenettes shall not
      be considered rooms.
    
        (2)  In  any  case  where  any housing accommodation was vacated on or
      after the effective date of this paragraph two, other than by  voluntary
      surrender  of  possession or in the manner provided in this chapter, the
      city rent agency may, by regulations having due regard for the  equities
      involved,  bar  adjustments  pursuant  to  subparagraphs  (f) and (g) of
      paragraph one of this subdivision g, except for work which:
        (a) is necessary in order to remove violations against the property;
        (b) is  necessary  to  obtain  a  certificate  of  occupancy  if  such
      certificate is required by law; or
        (c)  could have been performed with a tenant in physical possession of
      the housing accommodation.
        (3) Any adjustment pursuant  to  subparagraph  (a),  (b),  or  (c)  of
      paragraph one of this subdivision shall be subject to the limitation set
      forth in paragraph five of subdivision a of this section; provided:
        (a)  that in ordering an adjustment pursuant to such subparagraph (a),
      the city rent agency may waive such limitation where a greater  increase
      is  necessary  to  make  the  earned income of the property equal to its
      operating expenses; and
        (b) that where due to such limitation the landlord  will  not  receive
      the  full amount of the rent increase to which he or she would otherwise
      be entitled, the order of  the  city  rent  agency  shall  increase  the
      maximum  rent  by  a  further  additional  amount during each succeeding
      twelve-month period, not to exceed seven and a  half  percentum  of  the
      maximum  rent in effect on the date of the filing of the application for
      an adjustment, under the maximum rent shall reflect the full increase to
      which the landlord is entitled.
        (4) Any increase in maximum rent shall be apportioned equitably  among
      all  the  controlled  housing  accommodations in the property. In making
      such apportionment and in fixing the increases  in  maximum  rents,  the
      city  rent  agency  shall  give  due  consideration  (a) to all previous
      adjustments or increases in maximum rents by lease or otherwise; and (b)
      to all other income derived from the  property,  including  income  from
      space  and accommodations not controlled, or the rental value thereof if
      vacant or occupied rent-free, so there is allocated  to  the  controlled
      housing  accommodations  therein  only  that  portion  of  the amount of
      increases necessary pursuant to subparagraph (a), (b),  (c)  or  (k)  of
      paragraph one of this subdivision g, as is properly attributable to such
      controlled accommodations.
        (5)  The  city rent agency shall compile and make available for public
      inspection at reasonable hours at  its  principal  office  and  at  each
      appropriate  local  office,  the  manual  of  accounting  procedures and
      advisory bulletins applicable to applications under  subparagraphs  (a),
      (b)  and  (c) of paragraph one of this subdivision g, and all amendments
      to such manual and bulletins.
        (6) (a) No application for an increase in  any  maximum  rent  may  be
      filed  under  subparagraph  (a),  (b)  or  (c)  of paragraph one of this
      subdivision g with respect to any property unless there  is  annexed  to
      such application:
        (1)  A  report  of  search  issued  by  the  agency of the city having
      jurisdiction stating either that no violations against such property are
      recorded or a receipt (or  photocopy  thereof)  issued  by  that  agency
      attesting to the payment of the fee for the report of search or that all
      violations  recorded  against such property have been cleared, corrected
      or abated; and
        (2) A certification by the landlord of such property that he or she is
      maintaining all essential services required to be furnished and that  he
      or  she  will  continue  to  maintain  such services so long as any such
      increase in the maximum rent continues in effect.
    
        (b) Except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph  six  and
      paragraph  four  of  subdivision h of this section, no landlord shall be
      entitled to an increase in the maximum rent on any ground unless  he  or
      she  certifies  that  he  or  she  is maintaining all essential services
      furnished  or required to be furnished as of the date of the issuance of
      the order adjusting the maximum rent and that he or she will continue to
      maintain such services so long as the  increase  in  such  maximum  rent
      continues  in effect; nor shall any landlord be entitled to any increase
      in the maximum rent on any ground where an agency  of  the  city  having
      jurisdiction  certifies  that the housing accommodation is a fire hazard
      or is a continued dangerous condition or detrimental to life  or  health
      or  is  occupied in violation of law; nor shall any landlord be entitled
      to any increase where  the  landlord  has  not  removed  the  violations
      recorded against such property as shown in the report of search required
      under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph six.
        (c)  Where an application for an increase in any maximum rent is filed
      under subparagraph (f) and/or (g) of paragraph one of  this  subdivision
      g,  and  the  landlord  is not entitled to any increase by reason of the
      provisions of subparagraph (b) of this  paragraph  six,  the  city  rent
      agency may waive such provisions and issue orders increasing the maximum
      rent  effective  as  of the date of the issuance of the orders provided,
      however, that the landlord agrees  in  writing  to  deposit  the  entire
      amount  of  such  increase  in  maximum  rent  into  an  escrow  account
      administered by the city  rent  agency  in  accordance  with  rules  and
      regulations  to  be  promulgated  by  such  agency  for  the  purpose of
      obtaining compliance with such provisions and further agrees  to  obtain
      and  submit  to  the  city  rent agency within one year from the date of
      issuance of such orders; a report of search issued by the agency of  the
      city having jurisdiction stating that the violations shown in the report
      of  search  required  under  subparagraph (a) of this paragraph six have
      been  removed,  cleared,  corrected  or  abated,  and  his  or  her  own
      certification  that  he  or  she  is  and  will continue to maintain all
      essential services in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (b)
      of this paragraph six. In the event the landlord fails to  fully  comply
      with  such  provisions  within one year from the date of the issuance of
      the order increasing the maximum rent, the city agency may,  having  due
      regard  for  the  equities  involved, revoke such orders and direct full
      refund to the tenants of the entire increase paid by the  tenants  as  a
      result  of  such orders. Any person serving as escrow agent shall not be
      liable except for fraud or misfeasance.
        (d) No new maximum rent shall be  established  pursuant  to  paragraph
      three  or four of subdivision a of this section unless not more than one
      hundred fifty days nor less than ninety days prior to the effective date
      thereof, the landlord has certified that he or she  is  maintaining  all
      essential  services required to be furnished with respect to the housing
      accommodations covered by such certification, and that he  or  she  will
      continue  to  maintain such services so long as such new maximum rent is
      in effect. Each such certification filed to obtain a  new  maximum  rent
      pursuant  to  paragraph  four  of subdivision a of this section shall be
      accompanied by a certification by  the  landlord  that  he  or  she  has
      actually  expended  or incurred ninety per centum of the total amount of
      the cost index for operation and maintenance established for his or  her
      type of building.
        (e)  The  city  rent  agency  shall  establish a counseling service to
      provide assistance to tenants and to landlords of  buildings  containing
      nineteen  or  fewer housing accommodations, by way of instruction in the
      management, maintenance and  upkeep  of  housing  accommodations,  their
      respective   responsibilities  thereto,  the  programs  and  enforcement
    
      remedies available in the agency  and  from  other  city  agencies,  and
      assistance in the preparation of applications and other forms.
        (7)  Before  ordering  any  adjustment in maximum rents, the city rent
      agency shall accord a reasonable opportunity to be heard thereon to  the
      tenant and the landlord.
        h. (1) Whenever in the judgment of the city rent agency such action is
      necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,
      such   agency   may,  by  regulation  or  order,  regulate  or  prohibit
      speculative or manipulative practices or renting or  leasing  practices,
      including  practices  relating  to  recovery of possession, which in the
      judgment of such agency are equivalent to or are  likely  to  result  in
      rent increases inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter.
        (2)  Whenever  in the judgment of such agency such action is necessary
      or proper in order to effectuate the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  such
      agency  may  provide  regulations  to assure the maintenance of the same
      living space, essential services, furniture, furnishings  and  equipment
      as  were  provided  on  the  date determining the maximum rent, and such
      agency shall have power by regulation or order to decrease  the  maximum
      rent  or take action as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision h
      for any housing accommodation with respect to which a maximum rent is in
      effect, pursuant to this chapter, if  it  shall  find  that  the  living
      space,  essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment to which
      the tenant was entitled on such date have been decreased. The amount  of
      the  reduction  in  maximum  rent  ordered  by  such  agency  under this
      paragraph shall be reduced by any credit, abatement or  offset  in  rent
      which   the   tenant  has  received  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred
      thirty-five-b of the real property law  that  relates  to  one  or  more
      conditions covered by such order.
        (3) Whenever any agency of the city having jurisdiction certifies that
      any  housing  accommodation  is  a  fire  hazard  or  is  in a continued
      dangerous condition or detrimental to life or health, or is occupied  in
      violation of law, the city rent agency may issue an order decreasing the
      maximum  rent  or  take  action  as  provided  in paragraph four of this
      subdivision h for such housing accommodation in such amount as it  deems
      necessary  or  proper,  until  the agency issuing such certification has
      certified that such housing accommodation is no longer a fire  or  other
      hazard  and  is not in a condition detrimental to life and health and is
      not occupied in violation of law.
        (4) (a) Whenever in the judgment of the city rent agency  such  action
      is  necessary  or  proper  in  order  to effectuate the purposes of this
      chapter, such agency may, in lieu of decreasing  the  maximum  rents  as
      provided in paragraphs two and three of this subdivision h, enter into a
      contract  wherein  the  landlord agrees in writing to deposit all income
      derived  from  the  property,   including   income   from   spaces   and
      accommodations  not  controlled, into an escrow or trust account for use
      in maintaining  or  restoring  essential  services  and  equipment,  for
      removing  violations  against  the  property  or  housing accommodations
      therein, making such repairs as are necessary to remove a  certification
      from  any  city  agency  having  jurisdiction  thereof  that the housing
      accommodation is a fire hazard or is in a continued dangerous  condition
      or  detrimental  to  life or health, or is occupied in violation of law,
      and/or for such other uses as the city rent agency  deems  necessary  or
      proper  for the preservation, repair or maintenance of the property. The
      city rent agency may adopt such rules and regulations and orders  as  it
      may  deem  necessary  or  proper  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of this
      paragraph, including but not limited to the issuance of orders adjusting
      all controlled rents to the appropriate maximum rent effective as of the
      first day of the month following the execution of the contract provided,
    
      however, that in the event the city rent agency shall determine that the
      landlord has breached such contract, such agency may  issue  orders  (1)
      decreasing the maximum rents pursuant to such contract; (2) containing a
      directive that rent collected by the landlord in excess of the rent thus
      decreased  be  refunded  to  the  tenants; and (3) containing such other
      determinations and directives as are necessary in  order  to  effectuate
      the purposes of this paragraph four.
        (b)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this chapter to the contrary,
      whenever in the judgment of the city rent agency action as  provided  in
      paragraph  two  or three of this subdivision h is necessary or proper in
      order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,  such  agency  may  in
      lieu  of decreasing the maximum rents thereof issue orders adjusting all
      controlled rents and directing that rents be paid into an escrow account
      for the uses stated in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph four where:
        (1) The landlord fails to take corrective action after notice  by  the
      city  rent  agency  of  proposed  action  to  decrease the maximum rents
      pursuant to paragraph two or three of this subdivision h, and,
        (2) The city rent agency has notified all mortgagees  who  have  filed
      with the city rent agency a declaration of interest in such property and
      in such proposed action, and,
        (3)  The  landlord  has failed for three consecutive months to collect
      any  controlled  rents  or  to  commence  court  proceedings  for  their
      collection  or if such proceedings have been commenced, the landlord has
      not diligently prosecuted them or such proceedings have not resulted  in
      judgment in favor of such landlord.
        (c)  The  city  rent agency shall promulgate rules and regulations for
      the administration of escrow  and  trust  accounts  set  forth  in  this
      paragraph  four. Any person serving as escrow agent or trustee shall not
      be liable except for fraud, breach of fiduciary duties or misfeasance.
        (5)  Whenever  the  essential  services,  furnishings,  furniture   or
      equipment of any individual housing accommodation are reduced, impaired,
      mutilated,  or  made unworkable as the result of the neglect, failure to
      exercise due  care,  or  failure  of  the  tenant  to  take  practicable
      precautions  to  prevent such condition, the landlord shall restore such
      services,  furniture,  furnishings  or   equipment   and   pursuant   to
      regulations   to  be  prescribed  by  the  city  rent  agency  may  make
      application for a temporary increase in the maximum rent based upon  the
      cost  of such restoration.  In the event of the failure of the tenant to
      make restitution within a reasonable time, as  determined  by  the  city
      rent agency an order shall be issued adjusting the maximum rent for such
      tenant  in  an amount sufficient to recover the cost over twelve monthly
      installments, or until the tenant surrenders  possession,  whichever  is
      sooner.  The  provisions  of  this paragraph shall be in addition to all
      other rights and remedies of the landlord.
        (6) If at least six months before the effective date of any adjustment
      or establishment of  rents  pursuant  to  paragraph  three  or  four  of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section, the landlord has not certified to the
      agency having jurisdiction that (a) all rent  impairing  violations  (as
      defined  by  section  three hundred two-a of the multiple dwelling law),
      and (b) at least eighty per  centum  of  all  other  violations  of  the
      housing  maintenance  code  or  other  state  or  local laws that impose
      requirements on property that were recorded  against  the  property  one
      year  prior  to  such  effective  date  have been cleared, corrected, or
      abated, no increase pursuant to such paragraphs shall take effect  until
      he or she shall have entered into a written agreement with the city rent
      agency to deposit all income derived from the property into an escrow or
      trust  account  pursuant  to  subparagraph (a) of paragraph four of this
      subdivision, in addition to the procedures set forth in  this  paragraph
    
      and  all  other  applicable penalties and procedures under this chapter,
      such violation shall also be subject to repair or removal  by  the  city
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of article five of subchapter five of the
      housing  maintenance  code,  the  landlord  to  be  liable  for the cost
      thereof.
        i. Any regulation or order issued pursuant  to  this  section  may  be
      established  in  such  form and manner, may contain such classifications
      and differentiations, and may provide for such adjustments including the
      establishment of new or adjusted maximum rents in whole dollar  amounts,
      and  such  reasonable  exceptions  as  in  the judgment of the city rent
      agency are necessary or proper in order to effectuate  the  purposes  of
      this chapter.
        j. No increase or decrease in maximum rent shall be effective prior to
      the  date  on  which the order therefor is issued, except as hereinafter
      provided. If an application for an increase pursuant to subparagraph (a)
      of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section submitted on or  after
      August  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy is accompanied by a certified
      statement of expenditures and no order is  issued  thereon  within  four
      months  of  the  filing  of  an  application  based on assessed value or
      equalized  assessed  value,  or  eight  months  of  the  filing  of   an
      application  based  on  sale  price, with all required documentation the
      increased rent requested shall  thereafter  be  placed  in  an  interest
      bearing  escrow  account  until  a final determination is made upon such
      application by the city rent agency. Upon initial determination  by  the
      agency  an  order  shall  be  issued  providing  for  the payment of the
      increased amount, if any, due to the landlord from  the  date  of  first
      deposit  of  rent  in  said escrow account with interest, and the excess
      amount,  if  any,  be  paid  the  tenants  entitled  thereto,  with   an
      appropriate  amount  of  interest. The city rent agency shall promulgate
      rules and regulations for the administration of  such  escrow  accounts.
      Any  person serving as escrow agent shall not be liable except for fraud
      or misfeasance.
        k. Regulations,  orders,  and  requirements  under  this  chapter  may
      contain  such  provisions  as  the  city  rent agency deems necessary to
      prevent the circumvention or evasion thereof.
        l. The powers granted in this action shall not  be  used  or  made  to
      operate  to compel changes in established rental practices, except where
      such action is affirmatively  found  by  the  city  rent  agency  to  be
      necessary  to prevent circumvention or evasion of any regulation, order,
      or requirement under this chapter.
        m. Findings. The council finds that there is an acute  and  continuing
      housing  shortage;  that  this  shortage  has  and  continues to have an
      adverse effect on the population and especially on  inhabitants  of  the
      city  who  are  sixty-two years of age or older and of limited means, as
      well as persons with disabilities, who cannot pay enough rent to  induce
      private  enterprise  to maintain decent housing at rents they can afford
      to pay; that this condition is and continues to be particularly acute in
      a time of rising costs such as the present; that  present  rising  costs
      and  the  continuing increase in rents pursuant to amendments to the New
      York city rent and rehabilitation law may result in such  persons  being
      unable  to  pay  their  rent, thus making them subject to eviction; that
      such hardships fall with particular severity upon older persons  in  the
      population,  as  well  as  persons  with  disabilities, because of their
      particular inability to find  alternative  accommodations  within  their
      means,  because of the trauma experienced by many older persons, as well
      as persons with disabilities, who have to relocate and because they  may
      endanger  their health by paying additional sums for shelter and thereby
      deprive themselves of other necessities;  that  hardships  imposed  upon
    
      such  people  adversely  affect their health and welfare and the general
      welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The  council  is  aware  of  the
      provisions  set  forth  in chapter three hundred seventy-two and chapter
      one  thousand  twelve of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-one. It is
      our  considered  opinion  that  this  legislation  extending  the   rent
      exemption to cover the resultant rent increases due to the maximum rents
      established  January  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-two, is not more
      stringent or restrictive than those presently in effect. It is found and
      declared to be necessary for the health, welfare and safety  of  persons
      who  are  sixty-two years of age or older, persons with disabilities and
      inhabitants of the city that the city continue a system of special  rent
      adjustments  for such older persons, as well as extend such special rent
      adjustments to persons with disabilities as hereinafter provided.
        (1) No increase in maximum rent pursuant to paragraph two or paragraph
      three, four or five of subdivision a of this  section,  or  subparagraph
      (a),  (b),  (c),  (l)  or  (n) of paragraph one of subdivision g of this
      section, shall be collectible from a  tenant  to  whom  there  has  been
      issued   a  currently  valid  rent  exemption  order  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision, except as provided in such order.
        (2) A tenant is eligible for a rent exemption order pursuant  to  this
      subdivision if:
        (i) the head of the household residing in the housing accommodation is
      sixty-two years of age or older or is a person with a disability, and is
      entitled  to  the  possession  or  to the use or occupancy of a dwelling
      unit. To qualify as a person with a disability for the purposes of  this
      section,  an  individual  shall submit to such agency as the mayor shall
      designate proof (as specified by regulation of such agency as the  mayor
      shall  designate)  showing  that  such individual is currently receiving
      social security disability insurance  (SSDI)  or  supplemental  security
      income   (SSI)  benefits  under  the  federal  social  security  act  or
      disability pension or disability compensation benefits provided  by  the
      United States department of veterans affairs, or was previously eligible
      by  virtue  of  receiving  disability  benefits  under  the supplemental
      security income program or the social security disability program and is
      currently receiving medical assistance benefits based  on  determination
      of  disability  as  provided  in  section three hundred sixty-six of the
      social services law.
        Nothing herein contained shall render ineligible for benefits  persons
      receiving  supplemental security income or additional state payments, or
      both, under a program administered by the United  States  department  of
      health  and  human services or by such department and the New York State
      department of social services.
        (ii) the aggregate disposable income (as defined by regulation of  the
      department  of  finance) of all members of the household residing in the
      housing accommodation whose head of household is sixty-two years of  age
      or  older  does  not  exceed twenty-five thousand dollars beginning July
      first, two thousand five, twenty-six  thousand  dollars  beginning  July
      first,  two  thousand  six, twenty-seven thousand dollars beginning July
      first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand dollars beginning  July
      first,  two  thousand  eight, and twenty-nine thousand dollars beginning
      July first, two thousand nine, per year,  after  deduction  of  federal,
      state  and  city  income and social security taxes. For purposes of this
      subparagraph, "aggregate disposable income" shall not include  gifts  or
      inheritances,  payments  made  to individuals because of their status as
      victims of Nazi persecution, as defined in P.L. 103-286, or increases in
      benefits accorded pursuant to the social security act  or  a  public  or
      private  pension  paid to any member of the household which increase, in
      any given year, does not exceed the  consumer  price  index  (all  items
    
      United  States  city  average) for such year which take effect after the
      date of eligibility of a head of the household receiving benefits  under
      this  subdivision  whether  received by the head of the household or any
      other member of the household.
        (iii)  the  aggregate  disposable  income (as defined by regulation of
      such agency as the mayor shall designate) for  the  current  income  tax
      year   of   all  members  of  the  household  residing  in  the  housing
      accommodation whose head of the household is a person with a  disability
      pursuant  to this section does not exceed the maximum income above which
      such head of the  household  would  not  be  eligible  to  receive  cash
      supplemental  security income benefits under federal law during such tax
      year. For purposes of this subparagraph, "aggregate  disposable  income"
      shall  not  include  gifts or inheritances, payments made to individuals
      because of their status as victims of Nazi persecution,  as  defined  in
      P.L.  103-286,  or increases in benefits accorded pursuant to the social
      security act or a public or private pension paid to any  member  of  the
      household  which  increase,  in  any  given  year,  does  not exceed the
      consumer price index (all items United States  city  average)  for  such
      year  which  take  effect after the date of eligibility of a head of the
      household receiving benefits under this subdivision whether received  by
      the head of the household or any other member of the household.
        (iv) (a) in the case of a head of the household who does not receive a
      monthly  allowance  for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the
      maximum rent for the housing accommodations  exceeds  one-third  of  the
      aggregate  disposable  income or if any expected increase in the maximum
      rent pursuant to paragraph two, three, four or five of subdivision a  of
      this section, or subparagraph (a), (b), (c), (l) or (n) of paragraph one
      of subdivision g of this section would cause such maximum rent to exceed
      one-third of the aggregate disposable income; or
        (b)  in  the  case  of  a head of the household who receives a monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law,  the  maximum
      rent  for  the  housing accommodations exceeds the maximum allowance for
      shelter which the head of the household is entitled to receive  pursuant
      to  the  social  services law or if any expected increase in the maximum
      rent pursuant to paragraph two, three, four or five of subdivision a  of
      this section, or subparagraph (a), (b), (c), (l) or (n) of paragraph one
      of subdivision g of this section would cause such maximum rent to exceed
      the  maximum  allowance  for  shelter which the head of the household is
      entitled to receive.
        (3) (a) A rent exemption order  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall
      provide:
        (i)  in  the  case  of  a head of the household who does not receive a
      monthly allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law,  that
      the  landlord  may not collect from the tenant to whom it is issued rent
      at a rate in excess of one-third of the aggregate disposable income,  or
      the  maximum  collectible rent in effect on December thirty-first of the
      year preceding the effective date of the order, whichever is greater; or
        (ii) in the case of a head of the household  who  receives  a  monthly
      allowance  for  shelter  pursuant  to  the social services law, that the
      landlord may not collect from the tenant to whom it is issued rent at  a
      rate  in  excess  of  either the maximum allowance for shelter which the
      head of the household is entitled to receive, or the maximum collectible
      rent in effect on  December  thirty-first  of  the  year  preceding  the
      effective date of the order, whichever is greater; except,
        (iii)  that  the  landlord  may  collect from the tenants described in
      items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph increases in  rent  pursuant  to
      subparagraphs  (d),  (e),  and  (i) of paragraph one of subdivision g of
      this section.
    
        (b) Each order shall expire  upon  termination  of  occupancy  of  the
      housing  accommodation  by the tenant to whom it is issued. The landlord
      shall notify the department of finance, in the case of a household whose
      eligibility for such order is based on the fact that the  head  of  such
      household  is  sixty-two  years  of  age or older, or such agency as the
      mayor shall designate, in the case of a household whose eligibility  for
      such  order  is  based  on the fact that the head of such household is a
      person with a disability, on a form to be prescribed by such  department
      or agency, within thirty days of each such termination of occupancy.
        (c) When a rent reduction order is issued by the city rent agency, the
      amount of the reduction shall be subtracted from the rent payable by the
      tenant  specified  in  a  currently  valid  rent  exemption order issued
      pursuant to this subdivision. The landlord  may  not  collect  from  the
      tenant  a  sum  of  rent  exceeding  the  adjusted amount while the rent
      reduction order is in effect.
        (4) Any landlord who collects, or seeks to collect  or  enforce,  rent
      from a tenant in violation of the terms of a rent exemption order shall,
      for  the  purposes  of all remedies, sanctions and penalties provided in
      this chapter, be deemed to have collected or  attempted  to  collect  or
      enforce, a rent in excess of the legal maximum rent.
        (5)  A rent exemption order shall be issued to each tenant who applies
      to the department of finance or such agency as the mayor shall designate
      (which agency may also be the department of finance) in accordance  with
      such  department's  or  agency's  regulations  and  who  is  found to be
      eligible under this subdivision. Such order shall  take  effect  on  the
      first  day  of the first month after receipt of such application, except
      that where the  aggregate  disposable  income  of  all  members  of  the
      household  residing  in  the  housing  accommodation  whose  head of the
      household is sixty-two years of  age  or  older  is  greater  than  five
      thousand  dollars  per  year  but  does  not exceed twenty-five thousand
      dollars beginning July first, two  thousand  five,  twenty-six  thousand
      dollars  beginning  July  first, two thousand six, twenty-seven thousand
      dollars beginning July first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight  thousand
      dollars  beginning  July  first,  two  thousand  eight,  and twenty-nine
      thousand dollars beginning July  first,  two  thousand  nine,  per  year
      pursuant  to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph two of subdivision m of this
      section on orders issued on applications  received  before  July  first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-five, the effective date of such order shall be
      the  later  of  (1) June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-four or (2)
      the last day of the month in which a person becomes an eligible head  of
      household  in  the housing accommodation in which such person resides at
      the time of filing the most recent  application  for  a  rent  exemption
      order;  and  further,  except  that where any other application has been
      received within ninety days of the issuance of the order increasing  the
      tenant's  maximum  rent  pursuant  to  paragraph  three,  four or six of
      subdivision (a) of this section, or subparagraph (a), (b), (c),  or  (l)
      of paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this section or pursuant to court
      order,  whichever  is  later,  the  rent  exemption  order shall without
      further order take effect  as  of  the  effective  date  of  said  order
      increasing  the  tenant's  rent  including  any  retroactive  increments
      collectible pursuant to such orders.
        (6) A rent exemption order shall be valid for a period  of  two  years
      and  may be renewed for further two year periods upon application by the
      tenant; provided, that upon any such renewal application being  made  by
      the tenant, any rent exemption order then in effect with respect to such
      tenant  shall  be  deemed  renewed  until such time as the department of
      finance or such other agency as the mayor  shall  designate  shall  have
      found  such  tenant  to  be  either  eligible  or  ineligible for a rent
    
      exemption order but in no event for more than six additional months.  If
      such  tenant  is found eligible, the order shall be deemed to have taken
      effect upon expiration of the exemption. In  the  event  that  any  such
      tenant shall, subsequent to any such automatic renewal, not be granted a
      rent exemption order, such tenant shall be liable to his or her landlord
      for  the  difference  between  the  amounts he or she has paid under the
      provisions of the automatically renewed order and the amounts  which  he
      or she would have been required to pay in the absence of such order. Any
      rent  exemption  order issued pursuant to this subdivision shall include
      provisions giving notice as to the contents of this  paragraph  relating
      to  automatic  renewals  of  rent  exemption  orders. Any application or
      renewal application for a rent exemption order shall also constitute  an
      application  for  a  tax abatement under such section. The department of
      finance and such other agency as the mayor  shall  designate  may,  with
      respect  to renewal applications by tenants who have been found eligible
      for rent exemption orders,  prescribe  a  simplified  form  including  a
      certification  of  the  applicant's  continued  eligibility in lieu of a
      detailed statement of income and other qualifications.
        (7) Notwithstanding the provisions  of  this  chapter,  a  tenant  who
      resides in a housing accommodation which becomes subject to this chapter
      upon  the  sale  by  the  city of New York of the building in which such
      housing  accommodation  is  situated  may  be  issued  a  rent  increase
      exemption order for increases in rent which occurred during ownership of
      such  building  by  the city of New York provided that such tenant would
      have been otherwise eligible to receive a rent increase exemption  order
      at  the time of such increase but for the fact that such tenant occupied
      a housing accommodation owned by the city of New York and was  therefore
      not  subject  to  this  chapter.  Application  for  such  rent  increase
      exemption orders shall be made  within  one  year  from  the  date  such
      building  is  sold  by  the  city  of New York or within one year of the
      effective date of this provision, whichever is later.
        (8) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or chapter four  of
      this  title,  when  a  dwelling unit is subject to regulation under this
      chapter or chapter four of this title is reclassified  by  a  city  rent
      agency  order  subject  to  the  other  chapter, the tenant, who holds a
      senior citizen rent increase exemption order or disability rent increase
      exemption order at the time of  the  reclassification  or  is  otherwise
      eligible  and  entitled  to  an  exemption  order  from one or more rent
      increases but for the reclassification of  the  dwelling  unit,  may  be
      issued  a  rent  increase exemption order under the chapter to which the
      unit is thereafter subject by virtue of the reclassification  continuing
      the  previous  exemption  notwithstanding  the  reclassification  of the
      dwelling unit or, where no previous rent increase  exemption  order  has
      been  granted, issuing an initial order exempting the tenant from paying
      the rent increase to the extent for which he  or  she  would  have  been
      eligible  and  entitled  to  be exempted at the time of the increase and
      reclassification but for the fact of reclassification  of  the  dwelling
      unit  including  exemption  from  the  rent increase granted pursuant to
      subparagraph (m) of paragraph one of subdivision g of  this  section  to
      the extent that it is not predicated upon any improvement or addition in
      a  category  as  provided for in subparagraph (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or
      (i) of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section.  Application  for
      such rent increase exemption order shall be made within ninety days from
      the date of reclassification or within ninety days of the effective date
      of this paragraph, whichever is later. The rent increase exemption order
      shall take effect as of the effective date of reclassification including
      any retroactive increments pursuant to such rent increase.
    
        (9)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where
      a head of household holds a current, valid  rent  exemption  order  and,
      after  the  effective  date  of  this  paragraph,  there  is a permanent
      decrease in aggregate disposable  income  in  an  amount  which  exceeds
      twenty  percent  of  such  aggregate disposable income as represented in
      such head of the  household's  last  approved  application  for  a  rent
      exemption  order  or for renewal thereof, such head of the household may
      apply for a redetermination  of  the  amount  set  forth  therein.  Upon
      application, such amount shall be redetermined so as to re-establish the
      ratio  of  adjusted rent to aggregate disposable income which existed at
      the time of the approval of such eligible head of the  household's  last
      application for a rent exemption order or for renewal thereof; provided,
      however,  that  in  no  event  shall  the amount of the adjusted rent be
      redetermined to be (i) in the case of a head of the household  who  does
      not  receive  a  monthly  allowance  for  shelter pursuant to the social
      services law, less than one-third of the aggregate disposable income; or
      (ii) in the case of a head of  the  household  who  receives  a  monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, less than the
      maximum  allowance  for  shelter  which  such  head  of the household is
      entitled  to  receive  pursuant  to  such  law.  For  purposes  of  this
      paragraph,  a  decrease in aggregate disposable income shall not include
      any decrease in such income resulting from  the  manner  in  which  such
      income  is  calculated  pursuant  to  any  amendment  to  paragraph c of
      subdivision one of  section  four  hundred  sixty-seven-b  of  the  real
      property  tax law, any amendment to the regulations of the department of
      finance made on or after the effective date of the local law that  added
      this clause, or any amendment to the regulations of such other agency as
      the  mayor  shall designate made on or after October tenth, two thousand
      five. For purposes of this paragraph, "adjusted rent" shall mean maximum
      rent less the amount set forth in a rent exemption order.

Section 26-406 ::    
        
     
        §  26-406  Tax  abatement  for  properties  subject  to rent exemption
      orders.  a. Tax abatement, pursuant to the provisions  of  section  four
      hundred  sixty-seven-b  of  the  real property tax law, shall be granted
      with respect to any real property for which a rent  exemption  order  is
      issued  under  subdivision  m  of  section 26-405 of this chapter to the
      tenant  of  any  housing  accommodation  contained  therein.  The   rent
      exemption order shall constitute the tax abatement certificate.
        b. The real estate tax imposed upon any real property for which a rent
      exemption  order  is  issued,  shall  be reduced and abated by an amount
      equal to the difference  between  (1)  the  sum  of  the  maximum  rents
      collectible  under  such  orders, and (2) the sum of rents that would be
      collectible from the  tenants  of  such  housing  accommodations  if  no
      exemption  had  been granted pursuant to subdivision m of section 26-405
      of this chapter.
        c.  For  any  individual  housing  accommodation,  the  tax  abatement
      computed  pursuant  to  subdivision b of this section shall be available
      with respect to a period commencing on the effective date of the initial
      rent exemption order, or January first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-two,
      whichever  is  later, and ending on the expiration date of such order or
      on the effective date  of  an  order  terminating  the  rent  exemption.
      Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law, when a head of a household
      to whom a then current, valid tax abatement certificate has been  issued
      under  this  chapter,  chapter four or chapter seven of this title moves
      his or her principal residence to a subsequent dwelling unit subject  to
      regulation  under  this  chapter, the head of the household may apply to
      the department of finance or  such  other  agency  as  the  mayor  shall
      designate  for  a  tax  abatement certificate relating to the subsequent
      dwelling unit, and such certificate may provide that  the  head  of  the
      household  shall  be exempt from paying that portion of the maximum rent
      for the subsequent dwelling unit which is the least of the following:
        (1) the amount by which the rent  for  the  subsequent  dwelling  unit
      exceeds  the  last rent, as reduced, which the head of the household was
      required to actually pay in the original dwelling unit;
        (2) the last amount deducted from the maximum rent or legal  regulated
      rent  meaning the most recent monthly deduction for the applicant in the
      original dwelling unit pursuant  to  this  section,  section  26-509  or
      section 26-605 of this title; or
        (3)  where  the  head  of  the  household  does  not receive a monthly
      allowance for shelter pursuant to the social services law, the amount by
      which the maximum  rent  or  legal  regulated  rent  of  the  subsequent
      dwelling unit exceeds one-third of the combined income of all members of
      the household.
        Such  certificate  shall be effective as of the first day of the month
      in which the tenant applied for such exemption or as  of  the  date  the
      tenant  took  occupancy  of  the  subsequent dwelling unit, whichever is
      later, provided both occur after the effective date of this law.
        d. Prior to the commencement of each fiscal year,  the  department  of
      finance  shall  determine  the  total amount of taxes to be abated under
      this section with respect to each  property  for  which  rent  exemption
      orders granted to persons sixty-two years of age or older were in effect
      for  all  or  any  part  of  the  preceding  calendar year. Prior to the
      commencement of each  fiscal  year,  such  agency  as  the  mayor  shall
      designate  shall  determine and, if such agency is not the department of
      finance, shall notify the department of finance of the total  amount  of
      taxes  to be abated under this section with respect to each property for
      which rent exemption orders granted to persons with disabilities were in
      effect for  all  or  any  part  of  the  preceding  calendar  year.  The
    
      commissioner  of  finance  shall  make the appropriate adjustment in the
      real estate tax payable in such fiscal year.
        e.  Tax abatement pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any
      other tax abatement authorized by law, but shall not reduce the tax  for
      any  fiscal  year  below  zero.  In  the  event  that  the tax abatement
      certificate authorizes an amount of deduction  in  excess  of  the  real
      estate  installment,  then  the balance may be applied to any subsequent
      installment until exhausted. In such a case the owner shall submit  with
      his  or her real estate tax bill and remittance, a verified statement in
      such form as prescribed by the commissioner of finance setting forth the
      carry over amount and the amounts previously applied; provided, however,
      that at the request of the owner such balance shall be paid to the owner
      by the  commissioner  of  finance  in  lieu  of  being  applied  to  any
      subsequent  installment,  except  where  the  owner is in arrears in the
      payment of real estate taxes on any property. For the purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  where the owner is a corporation, it shall be deemed to be
      in arrears when any of the officers, directors or any person holding  an
      interest in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock of
      such  corporation  is  in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on
      any property; where title is held by  a  nominee,  the  owner  shall  be
      deemed  to be in arrears when the person for whose benefit such title is
      held is in arrears in the payment of real estate taxes on any property.

Section 26-407 ::    
        
     
        §  26-407  Labor cost pass-along. a. Notwithstanding any provisions of
      this chapter, any labor cost pass-along rent increase requested  of,  or
      received  from,  any  tenant  on  or  after July first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-two, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (1) of paragraph
      one of subdivision g of section 26-405 of this title, shall  not  exceed
      the  maximum  rent  adjustment  as provided under this chapter after the
      effective date of this section.
        b. All such increases in  excess  of  such  maximum  rent  are  hereby
      declared  null  and  void  and  of no effect. A tenant who paid any such
      excess increase shall be repaid by  a  cash  refund  or  credit,  to  be
      applied  against  future rent, in equal installments for the same number
      of months for which such increase was actually collected, commencing  on
      January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight.

Section 26-408 ::    
        
     
        §  26-408  Evictions.  a. No tenant, so long as he or she continues to
      pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled, shall  be  removed  from
      any  housing  accommodation  which is subject to rent control under this
      chapter by action to evict or to recover possession, by  exclusion  from
      possession,  or  otherwise, nor shall any person attempt such removal or
      exclusion from possession notwithstanding the fact that the  tenant  has
      no  lease  or  that  his  or  her  lease, or other rental agreement, has
      expired or otherwise terminated,  notwithstanding  any  contract,  lease
      agreement,  or  obligation  heretofore  or  hereafter entered into which
      provides for  surrender  of  possession,  or  which  otherwise  provides
      contrary  hereto,  except  on  one  or more of the following grounds, or
      unless the landlord has obtained a certificate of eviction  pursuant  to
      subdivision b of this section:
        (1)  The  tenant  is  violating a substantial obligation of his or her
      tenancy other than  the  obligation  to  surrender  possession  of  such
      housing  accommodation  and  has  failed  to  cure  such violation after
      written notice by the landlord that the violation cease within ten days,
      or within the three month period immediately prior to  the  commencement
      of  the  proceeding  the tenant has wilfully violated such an obligation
      inflicting serious and substantial injury to the landlord; or
        (2) The tenant is committing or permitting a nuisance in such  housing
      accommodation;  or  is  maliciously  or  by  reason  of gross negligence
      substantially damaging the housing accommodation; or his or her  conduct
      is such as to interfere substantially with the comfort and safety of the
      landlord  or of other tenants or occupants of the same or other adjacent
      building or structure; or
        (3) Occupancy of the housing accommodation by the  tenant  is  illegal
      because of the requirements of law, and the landlord is subject to civil
      or  criminal  penalties  therefor, or both, provided, however, that such
      occupancy shall not be considered illegal by reason of violations placed
      against the housing accommodations or the building  in  which  same  are
      located  by  any  department  or  agency of the city having jurisdiction
      unless such department or agency  has  issued  an  order  requiring  the
      tenants  to  vacate  said  accommodation  or  building  or  unless  such
      occupancy for such building or such violations relied on by the landlord
      result from an act, omission or  situation  caused  or  created  by  the
      tenant; or
        (4) The tenant is using or permitting such housing accommodation to be
      used for an immoral or illegal purpose; or
        (5)  The  tenant  who  had  a  written  lease  or other written rental
      agreement which terminated or shall terminate on  or  after  May  first,
      nineteen  hundred  fifty,  has  refused  upon  demand of the landlord to
      execute a written extension or renewal thereof for  a  further  term  of
      like  duration not in excess of one year but otherwise on the same terms
      and conditions as the previous lease except in so far as such terms  and
      conditions are inconsistent with this chapter; or
        (6)  The  tenant  has  unreasonably refused the landlord access to the
      housing accommodation for the purpose of  making  necessary  repairs  or
      improvements  required  by  law  or  for the purpose of inspection or of
      showing the accommodation  to  a  prospective  purchaser,  mortgagee  or
      prospective  mortgagee,  or  other  person  having a legitimate interest
      therein; provided, however, that in the latter event such refusal  shall
      not  be  ground for removal or eviction if such inspection or showing of
      the accommodation is contrary to the provisions of the tenant's lease or
      other rental agreement.
        (7) The eviction is sought by the owner of  a  dwelling  unit  or  the
      shares  allocated  thereto  where  such  dwelling  unit  is located in a
      structure owned as a cooperative or as a  condominium  and  an  offering
    
      prospectus  for the conversion of such structure pursuant to an eviction
      plan shall have been submitted  to  the  attorney  general  pursuant  to
      section  three  hundred  fifty-two-eeee  of the general business law and
      accepted for filing by the attorney general, and been declared effective
      in  accordance  with  such  law,  and  any  right of continued occupancy
      granted by such law to a non-purchasing  tenant  in  occupancy  of  such
      dwelling  unit  shall  have  expired;  provided  that  the  owner of the
      dwelling unit or the shares allocated thereto seeks  in  good  faith  to
      recover  possession  of  a dwelling unit for his or her own personal use
      and occupancy or for the use and  occupancy  of  his  or  her  immediate
      family.
        b.  No  tenant shall be removed or evicted on grounds other than those
      stated in subdivision a of this section unless  on  application  of  the
      landlord   the  city  rent  agency  shall  issue  an  order  granting  a
      certificate of eviction in accordance with  its  rules  and  regulations
      designed  to  effectuate  the  purposes  of  this  title, permitting the
      landlord to pursue his or her remedies at  law.  The  city  rent  agency
      shall issue such an order whenever it finds that:
        (1)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
      housing accommodation because of immediate and compelling necessity  for
      his  or  her own personal use and occupancy or for the use and occupancy
      of his or her immediate family provided, however, that this  subdivision
      shall  not  apply where a member of the household lawfully occupying the
      housing accommodation is sixty-two years of age or  older,  has  been  a
      tenant  in  a housing accommodation in that building for twenty years or
      more, or has an impairment which results from anatomical,  physiological
      or  psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling,
      or  any  controlled  substance,  which  are  demonstrable  by  medically
      acceptable  clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are
      expected to be permanent and which prevent the tenant from  engaging  in
      any substantial gainful employment; or
        (2)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
      housing accommodation for which  the  tenant's  lease  or  other  rental
      agreement  has  expired  or  otherwise  terminated,  and  at the time of
      termination the occupants of the housing accommodation are subtenants or
      other persons who occupied under a rental agreement with the tenant, and
      no part of the accommodation is  used  by  the  tenant  as  his  or  her
      dwelling; or
        (3)  The  landlord  seeks  in  good  faith  to recover possession of a
      housing  accommodation  for  the  immediate  purpose  of   substantially
      altering or remodeling it, provided that the landlord shall have secured
      such  approval  therefor  as is required by law and the city rent agency
      determines that the issuance of the order granting  the  certificate  of
      eviction is not inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter; or
        (4)  The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of housing
      accommodations for the immediate purpose of demolishing  them,  and  the
      city  rent  agency determines that such demolition is to be effected for
      the purpose of constructing a new building, provided that:
        (a) If the purpose of such demolition is to construct a  new  building
      containing  housing  accommodations, no certificate of eviction shall be
      granted under this paragraph unless such agency determines that such new
      building  will  contain  at  least  twenty  per  centum   more   housing
      accommodations  consisting of self-contained family units (as defined by
      regulations issued by such agency, with due regard for the  shortage  of
      housing  accommodations  suitable  for  family  occupancy  and  for  the
      purposes of this chapter in relation thereto) than are contained in  the
      structure  to  be demolished; except, however, that where as a result of
      conditions detrimental to life or health of the tenants, violations have
    
      been placed upon the structure containing the housing accommodations  by
      any  agency  of  the  city having jurisdiction over such matters and the
      cost of removing such violations would  be  substantially  equal  to  or
      would  exceed  the assessed valuation of the structure, the new building
      shall only be required to make provision for a greater number of housing
      accommodations consisting of self-contained family units (as so  defined
      by regulation) than are contained in the structure to be demolished; and
        (b)  The  city rent agency shall, by regulation, as a condition to the
      granting of certificates of eviction under this paragraph,  require  the
      relocation  of  the  tenants  in other suitable accommodations, provided
      that the city rent agency may, by regulation, authorize the granting  of
      such  certificates  as to any tenants or classes of tenants without such
      requirement of relocation, where  such  exemption  will  not  result  in
      hardship  to  such  tenants  or  classes  of  tenants  and  will  not be
      inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter; and
        (c) The city rent agency may, by regulation, in order to carry out the
      purposes of this chapter, impose additional conditions to  the  granting
      of  certificates  of  eviction  under this paragraph, including, but not
      limited to, the payment of stipends to the tenants by  the  landlord  in
      such  amounts and subject to such variations and classifications as such
      agency may determine to be reasonably necessary; and
        (d) No certificate of  eviction  shall  be  issued  pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  unless  the  landlord  shall have secured such approval as is
      required by law for the construction sought to be effected, and the city
      rent agency determines that the issuance  of  such  certificate  is  not
      inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter.
        (5)  Notwithstanding  any provisions to the contrary contained in this
      subdivision or in subdivision d of section 26-410 of this chapter or  in
      the local emergency housing rent control act:
        (a) no application for a certificate of eviction under paragraph three
      or  four  of  this  subdivision  and no application for a certificate of
      eviction under paragraph one of subdivision j or under subdivision c  of
      this section for the purpose of withdrawing a housing accommodation from
      the  housing  market on the grounds that the continued operation of such
      housing accommodation would impose undue  hardship  upon  the  landlord,
      pending  or  made on or after the effective date hereof shall be granted
      by the city rent agency unless the city rent agency finds that there  is
      no reasonable possibility that the landlord can make a net annual return
      of  eight  and  one-half per centum of the assessed value of the subject
      property without recourse to the remedy provided in said paragraph three
      or four or said subdivision c or j and finds that neither  the  landlord
      nor  his  or  her immediate predecessor in interest has intentionally or
      willfully managed the property to impair the landlord's ability to  earn
      such return; and
        (b)  the  effectiveness of any certificate of eviction or of any order
      granting a certificate of eviction pursuant to paragraphs three and four
      of this subdivision shall be suspended, and no  tenant  may  be  evicted
      pursuant to any such certificate or order, unless the city rent agency:
        (i)  finds  that  there is no reasonable possibility that the landlord
      can make a net annual return of eight and one-half  per  centum  of  the
      assessed  value  of  the subject property without recourse to the remedy
      provided in said paragraphs three and four and finds  that  neither  the
      landlord   nor   his  or  her  immediate  predecessor  in  interest  has
      intentionally or willfully managed the property to impair the landlord's
      ability to earn such return; and
        (ii) issues an order reinstating the effectiveness of any  certificate
      of  eviction  suspended  pursuant to this paragraph. The pendency of any
    
      judicial proceeding or appeal shall in no way prevent the taking  effect
      of the relief granted in this subparagraph.
        (c) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to an application
      for  a  certificate  of  eviction  from a housing accommodation when the
      landlord seeks in good faith  to  recover  possession  thereof  for  the
      immediate purpose of substantially altering or remodelling it or for the
      immediate  purpose  of  demolishing it for the purpose of constructing a
      new building when such altering or remodelling or  the  construction  of
      such  new  building  is to be aided by interest reduction payments under
      section two hundred thirty-six of the national housing act.
        (6) Neither the provisions of subparagraph (a) of  paragraph  four  of
      this  subdivision, which require that the new building contain more than
      or equal to the number of housing accommodations that are  contained  in
      the structure to be demolished or substantially altered or remodeled nor
      the  provisions  of  paragraph five of this subdivision shall apply with
      respect to any building in  which  there  remains  (A)  three  or  fewer
      occupied  apartments  which  constitute ten percent or less of the total
      dwelling units in the building or (B)  one  occupied  apartment  if  the
      building contains ten or fewer apartments but only on the condition that
      the  tenant is provided with the relocation, moving expense, stipend and
      any other benefits provided under the corresponding  provisions  of  the
      rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine. In the event of a
      substantial  alteration  or  remodeling of a building falling within the
      limitations  of  this  paragraph,  all  of  the  relocation   provisions
      available to an owner for demolition shall apply.
        c.  The  city  rent  agency  may  from time to time, to effectuate the
      purposes of this chapter,  adopt,  promulgate,  amend  or  rescind  such
      rules,  regulations or orders as it may deem necessary or proper for the
      control of evictions. Any such rules, regulations or orders may include,
      in addition to any other  provisions  authorized  by  this  subdivision,
      provisions  restricting  the filing of applications for, or the issuance
      of orders granting, certificates of eviction  where  such  agency  finds
      that  a  course  of  conduct  has been engaged in which is proscribed by
      subdivision d of section 26-412 of this chapter. The agency  shall  also
      require,  prior  to the filing of plans with the department of buildings
      for a new building or alteration  on  the  site  of  controlled  housing
      accommodations  and  prior  to the filing of an application for a permit
      for the demolition or removal of an  existing  multiple  dwelling  which
      contains  controlled  housing accommodations, that the applicant certify
      to and file with the agency such information and  give  such  notice  to
      tenants  as  it  deems  necessary  to  prevent  evasion  of  the law and
      regulations governing evictions. It  may  also  require  that  an  order
      granting  a  certificate  of  eviction  be obtained from it prior to the
      institution of any action or proceeding for the recovery  of  possession
      of  any housing accommodation subject to rent control under this chapter
      upon the grounds specified in subdivision b of this section or where  it
      finds  that  the  requested removal or eviction is not inconsistent with
      the purposes of this chapter and  would  not  be  likely  to  result  in
      circumvention  or evasion thereof; provided, however, that no such order
      shall be required in any action or proceeding brought  pursuant  to  the
      provisions of subdivision a of this section.
        d.  (1)  The city rent agency, on its own initiative or on application
      of a tenant, may revoke or cancel an order  granting  a  certificate  of
      eviction  at  any  time prior to the execution of a warrant in a summary
      proceeding to recover possession of real property by a court whenever it
      finds that:
        (a) The certificate of eviction was obtained by fraud  or  illegality;
      or
    
        (b)  The  landlord's  intentions or circumstances have so changed that
      the premises, possession of which is sought, will not be  used  for  the
      purpose specified in the certificate.
        (2) The commencement of a proceeding by the city rent agency to revoke
      or  cancel  an  order granting a certificate of eviction shall stay such
      order until the final determination  of  the  proceeding  regardless  of
      whether  the  waiting  period  in  the order has already expired. In the
      event the city rent agency cancels or revokes such an order,  the  court
      having  jurisdiction  of  any summary proceeding instituted in such case
      shall take appropriate action to dismiss the application for removal  of
      the  tenant  from  the  real  property and to vacate and annul any final
      order or warrant granted or issued by the court in the matter.
        e. Notwithstanding the  preceding  provisions  of  this  section,  the
      state,  the  city,  or  the  New York city housing authority may recover
      possession of any housing  accommodations  operated  by  it  where  such
      action or proceeding is authorized by statute or regulations under which
      such accommodations are administered.
        f.  Any  order  of  the city rent agency under this section granting a
      certificate of eviction shall be subject to judicial review only in  the
      manner  prescribed  by  subdivision  eight  of  section one of the state
      enabling act and sections 26-410 and 26-411 of this chapter.
        g. (1) Where after the city rent agency has granted a  certificate  of
      eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
      to  law  to  acquire  possession and a tenant voluntarily removes from a
      housing accommodation  or  has  been  removed  therefrom  by  action  or
      proceeding   to   evict   from   or  recover  possession  of  a  housing
      accommodation upon the ground that the landlord seeks in good  faith  to
      recover possession of such accommodation:
        (a)  For  his  or her immediate and personal use, or for the immediate
      and personal use by a member or members of his or her immediate  family,
      and  such  landlord or members of his or her immediate family shall fail
      to occupy  such  accommodation  within  thirty  days  after  the  tenant
      vacates,  or  such  landlord  shall  lease  or rent such space or permit
      occupancy thereof by a third person within a period of  one  year  after
      such removal of the tenant; or
        (b)   For   the   immediate   purpose   of  withdrawing  such  housing
      accommodation from the rental market and such landlord  shall  lease  or
      sell the housing accommodation or the space previously occupied thereby,
      or  permit  use  thereof  in  a  manner  other than contemplated in such
      eviction certificate within a period of one year after such  removal  of
      the tenant; or
        (c)  For  the immediate purpose of altering or remodeling such housing
      accommodation, and  the  landlord  shall  fail  to  start  the  work  of
      alteration  or  remodeling  of  such housing accommodation within ninety
      days after the removal, on the ground that he or she required possession
      for the purpose of effecting such alteration or remodeling, of the  last
      tenant  whose removal is necessary to enable the landlord to effect such
      alteration or remodeling of  such  accommodation,  or  if  after  having
      commenced  such  work  shall  fail or neglect to prosecute the work with
      reasonable diligence; or
        (d)  For  the  immediate   purpose   of   demolishing   such   housing
      accommodations  and  constructing  a  new  building  in  accordance with
      approved plans, or reasonable amendment thereof, and  the  landlord  has
      failed to complete the demolition within six months after the removal of
      the  last  tenant  or,  having  demolished  the  premises, has failed or
      neglected to proceed with the new construction within ninety days  after
      the completion of such demolition, or having commenced such construction
    
      work  has  failed  or  neglected  to prosecute such work with reasonable
      diligence; or
        (e)  For  some  purpose other than those specified above for which the
      removal of the tenant was sought and the landlord has failed to use  the
      vacated  premises for such purpose; such landlord shall, unless for good
      cause shown, be liable  to  the  tenant  for  three  times  the  damages
      sustained on account of such removal plus reasonable attorney's fees and
      costs  as  determined by the court. In addition to any other damage, the
      cost of removal of property shall be a lawful  measure  of  damage.  The
      remedy herein provided for shall be in addition to those provided for in
      subdivision  h  of  this  section,  paragraph  (a) of subdivision ten of
      section one of the state enabling  act  and  subdivision  a  of  section
      26-413 of this chapter.
        (2)  The  acts and omissions mentioned in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c),
      (d) and (e) of paragraph one of this  subdivision,  on  the  part  of  a
      landlord  after  issuance  of  a  certificate  of  eviction,  are hereby
      declared to be inconsistent with the purposes for which such certificate
      of eviction was issued.
        h. Where after the city rent  agency  has  granted  a  certificate  of
      eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
      to  law to acquire possession for any purpose stated in subdivision b or
      j of this section or  for  some  other  stated  purpose,  and  a  tenant
      voluntarily  removes  from  a  housing accommodation or has been removed
      therefrom by action or proceeding to evict from or recover possession of
      a housing accommodation and the landlord or any  successor  landlord  of
      the  premises  does  not  use  the housing accommodation for the purpose
      specified in such certificate of eviction, the vacated accommodation  or
      any  replacement  or  subdivision  thereof  shall,  unless the city rent
      agency  approves  such  different   purpose,   be   deemed   a   housing
      accommodation subject to control, notwithstanding any definition of that
      term  in  this  chapter  to the contrary. Such approval shall be granted
      whenever the city rent agency finds that the failure or omission to  use
      the  housing accommodation for the purpose specified in such certificate
      was not inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter and would  not  be
      likely  to  result  in  the circumvention or evasion thereof. The remedy
      herein provided for shall be  in  addition  to  those  provided  for  in
      subdivision  g  of  this  section,  paragraph  (a) of subdivision ten of
      section one of the state enabling  act  and  subdivision  a  of  section
      26-413 of this chapter.
        i.  Any  statutory  tenant who vacates a housing accommodation without
      giving the landlord at least thirty days' written notice  by  registered
      or  certified mail of his or her intention to vacate, shall be liable to
      the landlord for the loss of rent suffered  by  the  landlord,  but  not
      exceeding  one month's rent, except where the tenant has been removed or
      vacates pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such notice shall be
      postmarked on or before the last day of the  rental  period  immediately
      prior to such thirty-day period.
        j.  (1)  Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall be construed to require any
      person to  offer  any  housing  accommodations  for  rent,  but  housing
      accommodations  already on the rental market may be withdrawn only after
      prior written approval of the  city  rent  agency,  if  such  withdrawal
      requires that a tenant be evicted from such accommodations.
        (2)  The  city rent agency, in order to carry out the purposes of this
      chapter, may issue regulations providing for issuance of certificates of
      eviction in any case where the landlord seeks such approval in order  to
      use the premises (including the building or land) (a) for the purpose of
      conducting a business, or (b) where the landlord is a hospital, convent,
      asylum,  public institution, college, school or any institution operated
    
      exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes on  a  non
      profit  basis  and  the landlord seeks such approval in order to use the
      premises (including the  building  or  land)  or  any  part  thereof  in
      connection  with  the  landlord's  charitable,  religious or educational
      purposes; such agency, if it grants approval, shall condition same  upon
      compliance  by  the  landlord  with  designated  requirements  which may
      consist of any conditions that  such  agency  would  have  authority  to
      prescribe  by  regulation  under  subparagraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph
      four of subdivision b of this section with respect to  applications  for
      certificates  of  eviction  under such paragraph four provided, however,
      that such agency shall not condition any  such  approval  granted  to  a
      hospital,  convent,  asylum, public institution, college, school, or any
      institution  operated   exclusively   for   charitable,   religious   or
      educational purposes upon compliance with requirements exceeding or less
      than  those  applicable  to  any private owner in similar circumstances.
      Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing or
      requiring  such  agency  to  approve  the  withdrawal  of  any   housing
      accommodations from the rental market by any landlord for the purpose of
      using  the  premises  for  any  business other than one in existence and
      conducted by such landlord at the time such  withdrawal  is  sought.  No
      certificate  of eviction shall be issued to a nonprofit school, college,
      hospital, or other charitable institution, including without limitation,
      any organization exempt from taxation under the Federal Internal Revenue
      Code, which seeks to recover possession of the housing accommodations or
      to withdraw such accommodations from the rental  or  non-rental  housing
      market,  for  immediate  and  personal  use  and  occupancy  as  housing
      accommodations by its employees, students or members of its staff.
        k. The city rent agency by order issued pursuant  to  its  regulations
      may  waive  the  requirements of subdivision b of this section where (1)
      the housing accommodations were vacant at the time  when  landlord  made
      application  for such waiver, and (2) were vacated by reason of the last
      tenant's voluntary surrender thereof, and  (3)  the  landlord,  in  good
      faith, intends to demolish or substantially rehabilitate the building in
      which the housing accommodations are located within a period approved by
      the  city  rent  agency.  The failure of the landlord to comply with the
      conditions established by the city rent agency for the granting  of  the
      application   shall  subject  the  housing  accommodations  to  all  the
      provisions of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 26-409
--------------

Section 26-409 ::    
        
     
        §  26-409  Investigation; records; reports. a. The city rent agency is
      authorized to make such studies  and  investigations,  to  conduct  such
      hearings, and to obtain such information as it deems necessary or proper
      in  prescribing  any  regulation or order pursuant to this chapter or in
      administering and enforcing this chapter and the regulations and  orders
      thereunder  or  the  state  rent  act  and  the  regulations  and orders
      thereunder.
        b. The city rent agency is further authorized, by regulation or order,
      to require any person who rents or offers for rent or acts as broker  or
      agent  for  the rental of any housing accommodations to furnish any such
      information under oath or affirmation, or otherwise, to  make  and  keep
      records  and  other  documents,  and to make reports, including, but not
      limited to, reports with  respect  to  decontrolled  or  exempt  housing
      accommodations,  and the city rent agency may require any such person to
      permit the inspection and copying of records and other documents and the
      inspection of housing accommodations. Any officer or agent designated by
      the city  rent  agency  for  such  purposes  may  administer  oaths  and
      affirmations  and may, whenever necessary, by subpoena, require any such
      person to appear and testify or to  appear  and  produce  documents,  or
      both, at any designated place.
        c.  For  the  purpose of obtaining any information under this section,
      the city rent agency may by subpoena require any other person to  appear
      and  testify  or  to  appear  and  produce  documents,  or  both, at any
      designated place.
        d. The production of a person's documents at any place other than  his
      or her place of business shall not be required under this section in any
      case in which, prior to the return date specified in the subpoena issued
      with  respect  thereto,  such  person either has furnished the city rent
      agency with a copy of such documents certified by such person under oath
      to be a true and correct copy, or has entered into  a  stipulation  with
      the city rent agency as to the information contained in such documents.
        e. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon,
      any  person referred to in this section, the supreme court in or for any
      judicial district in which such person is found or resides or  transacts
      business,   upon  application  by  the  city  rent  agency,  shall  have
      jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and  give
      testimony  or  to appear and produce documents, or both; and any failure
      to obey such order of the court may be  punished  by  such  court  as  a
      contempt  thereof.  The  provisions  of  this  subdivision e shall be in
      addition to the provisions of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  nine  of
      section  one  of  the  state  enabling  act and subdivision a of section
      26-412 of this chapter.
        f. Witnesses subpoenaed under this section shall be paid the same  fee
      and mileage as are paid witnesses pursuant to the civil practice law and
      rules.
        g. Upon any such investigation or hearing, the city rent agency, or an
      officer  duly  designated  by  the  city  rent  agency  to  conduct such
      investigation or hearing, may confer immunity  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions of the criminal procedure law.
        h.  The city rent agency shall not publish or disclose any information
      obtained under this chapter that the city rent agency deems confidential
      or with reference to which a request for confidential treatment is  made
      by  the  person furnishing such information, unless the city rent agency
      determines that the  withholding  thereof  is  contrary  to  the  public
      interest.
        i.  Any  person  subpoenaed under this section shall have the right to
      make a record of his or her testimony and to be represented by counsel.
    
        j. Without limiting any power granted by this  section  or  any  other
      provision  of  law,  the  city rent agency may by regulation require the
      owner of a building or property containing both  housing  accommodations
      subject  to  this  chapter and housing accommodations subject to chapter
      four  of  this  title  to  execute and file registration statements with
      respect to the housing accommodations subject to this chapter along with
      those filed pursuant to such chapter  four.  Notwithstanding  any  other
      provisions  of  law,  such  agency  may promulgate regulations, and take
      other necessary or appropriate actions,  pursuant  to  this  subdivision
      prior to April first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, to take effect on or
      after such date.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 26-410
--------------

Section 26-410 ::    
        
     
        §  26-410  Procedure. a. After the issuance of any regulation or order
      by the city rent agency, any person subject to  any  provision  of  such
      regulation or order may, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed
      by  such  agency,  file  a  protest  against  such  regulation  or order
      specifically setting forth his or her objections to any such  provisions
      and  affidavits or other written evidence in support of such objections.
      Statements in support of any such regulation or order  may  be  received
      and  incorporated  in the record of the proceedings at such times and in
      accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed  by  such  agency.
      Within  a  reasonable  time  after  the filing of any protest under this
      section, such agency shall either grant or deny such protest in whole or
      in part, notice such protest for hearing, or provide an  opportunity  to
      present further evidence in connection therewith. In the event that such
      agency  denies any such protest in whole or in part, it shall inform the
      protestant of the grounds upon which such decision is based, and of  any
      economic data and other facts of which it has taken official notice.
        b.  In  the  administration  of this chapter, the city rent agency may
      take official notice of economic data and other facts,  including  facts
      found  by  it  as  a result of action taken under section 26-405 of this
      chapter.
        c. Any proceedings under this section may be limited by the city  rent
      agency  to  the filing of affidavits, or other written evidence, and the
      filing of briefs, except that no  multiple-tenant  initiated  proceeding
      for  the  reduction  of  rents in a building may be determined without a
      hearing.
        d. Any protest filed under this section shall be granted or denied  by
      the city rent agency, or granted in part and the remainder of it denied,
      within  a reasonable time after it is filed. If such agency does not act
      finally within a period of ninety days after the protest is  filed,  the
      protest shall be deemed to be denied. However, such agency may grant one
      extension not to exceed thirty days with the consent of the party filing
      such protest; any further extension may only be granted with the consent
      of  all parties to the protest. No proceeding may be brought pursuant to
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules  to  challenge
      any  order or determination which is subject to such protest unless such
      review has been sought and either (1) a determination thereon  has  been
      made  or  (2)  the  ninety-day  period provided for determination of the
      protest (or any extension thereof) has expired. If such agency does  not
      act  finally  within a period of ninety days after the entry of an order
      of remand to such  agency  by  the  court  in  a  proceeding  instituted
      pursuant  to  subdivision eight of section one of the state enabling act
      or section 26-411 of this chapter, the order  previously  made  by  such
      agency  shall  be  deemed reaffirmed. However, such agency may grant one
      extension not to exceed thirty days with the consent of the  petitioner;
      any  further  extension  may  only  be  granted  with the consent of all
      parties to the petition.
        e. The city rent agency shall compile and make  available  for  public
      inspection  at  reasonable  hours  at  its  principal office and at each
      appropriate local office a copy of each decision  rendered  by  it  upon
      granting, or denying, in whole or in part, any protests filed under this
      section  and  shall  have  available  at each appropriate local office a
      register of properties concerning which a vacate order was issued  by  a
      city  department having jurisdiction or proceedings have been brought to
      determine whether any housing accommodations therein became vacant as  a
      result  of conduct proscribed by subdivision d of section 26-412 of this
      chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 26-411
--------------

Section 26-411 ::    
        
     
        §  26-411  Judicial  review. a. (1) Any person who is aggrieved by the
      final determination  of  the  city  rent  agency  in  an  administrative
      proceeding  protesting  a  regulation  or  order  of such agency may, in
      accordance with article seventy-eight of  the  civil  practice  law  and
      rules, within sixty days after such determination, commence a proceeding
      in  the  supreme court. The petition shall specify his or her objections
      and pray that the regulation or order protested be enjoined or set aside
      in whole or in part. Such proceeding may at the option of the petitioner
      be instituted in the county where the city rent agency has its principal
      office or where the property is located. The city rent agency shall file
      with such court the original or a transcript of  such  portions  of  the
      proceedings  in  connection with its final determination as are material
      under the petition. Such return shall include a statement setting forth,
      so far as practicable, the economic data and other facts  of  which  the
      city  rent  agency  has  taken  official notice. Upon the filing of such
      petition the court shall have jurisdiction to set aside  the  regulation
      or  order protested, in whole or in part, to dismiss the petition, or to
      remit the proceeding to the city rent agency,  provided,  however,  that
      the  regulation  or  order may be modified or rescinded by the city rent
      agency at any time notwithstanding the pendency of such  proceeding  for
      review.
        (2)  No  objection  to  such  regulation  or order, and no evidence in
      support of any objection thereto, shall  be  considered  by  the  court,
      unless  such objection shall have been presented to the city rent agency
      by the petitioner in the proceedings resulting in the  determination  or
      unless such evidence shall be contained in the return. If application is
      made  to  the  court  by  either party for leave to introduce additional
      evidence which was either offered and not admitted or  which  could  not
      reasonably  have been offered or included in such proceedings before the
      city rent agency, and the court determines that such evidence should  be
      admitted, the court shall order the evidence to be presented to the city
      rent  agency.  The city rent agency shall promptly receive the same, and
      such other evidence as the city rent agency deems necessary  or  proper,
      and  thereupon  the  city  rent  agency  shall  file  with the court the
      original or a transcript thereof  and  any  modification  made  in  such
      regulation  or  order as a result thereof; except that on request by the
      city rent agency, any such evidence shall be presented directly  to  the
      court.  Upon final determination of the proceeding before the court, the
      original record, if filed by the city rent agency with the court,  shall
      be returned to the city rent agency.
        b. No regulation or order of the city rent agency shall be enjoined or
      set aside, in whole or in part, unless the petitioner shall establish to
      the  satisfaction  of  the  court that the regulation or order is not in
      accordance with law, or is arbitrary or capricious. The effectiveness of
      an order of the court enjoining or setting aside, in whole or  in  part,
      any  such regulation or order shall be postponed until the expiration of
      thirty days from the entry thereof.  The  jurisdiction  of  the  supreme
      court  shall  be  exclusive  and  its  order  dismissing the petition or
      enjoining or setting aside such regulation or  order,  in  whole  or  in
      part, shall be final, subject to review by the appellate division of the
      supreme  court  and the court of appeals in the same manner and form and
      with the same effect as provided in the civil practice law and rules for
      appeals from a final order in a special proceeding. Notwithstanding  any
      provision  of  paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section five thousand
      seven hundred one of the civil practice law and rules to  the  contrary,
      any  order of the court remitting the proceeding to the city rent agency
      may, at the election of the city rent agency, be subject  to  review  by
      the  appellate division of the supreme court and the court of appeals in
    
      the same manner and form and with the same effect  as  provided  in  the
      civil practice law and rules for appeals from a final order in a special
      proceeding.  All  such  proceedings shall be heard and determined by the
      court  and  by any appellate court as expeditiously as possible and with
      lawful precedence over other matters. All such  proceedings  for  review
      shall  be  heard  on  the  petition, manuscript and other papers, and on
      appeal shall be heard on the record, without requirement of printing.
        c. Within thirty days after arraignment, or such  additional  time  as
      the  court  may  allow for good cause shown, in any criminal proceeding,
      and within five days after judgment in any civil or criminal proceeding,
      brought pursuant to subdivision ten of section one of the state enabling
      act or section 26-413 of this chapter involving alleged violation of any
      provision of any regulation or  order  of  the  city  rent  agency,  the
      defendant  may apply to the court in which the proceeding is pending for
      leave to file in the supreme court a petition setting  forth  objections
      to  the validity of any provision which the defendant is alleged to have
      violated or conspired to violate. The court in which the  proceeding  is
      pending  shall  grant  such leave with respect to any objection which it
      finds is made in good faith and with respect to which it finds there  is
      reasonable and substantial excuse for the defendant's failure to present
      such  objection  in  an  administrative  proceeding before the city rent
      agency. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to and within thirty days
      from  the  granting  of  such  leave,  the  supreme  court  shall   have
      jurisdiction to enjoin or set aside in whole or in part the provision of
      the  regulation  or  order complained of or to dismiss the petition. The
      court may authorize the introduction of evidence,  either  to  the  city
      rent  agency  or directly to the court, in accordance with subdivision a
      of this section. The provisions of subdivision b of this  section  shall
      be  applicable  with respect to any proceedings instituted in accordance
      with this subdivision.
        d. In any proceeding brought pursuant to subdivision  ten  of  section
      one  of  the  state  enabling  act  or  section  26-413  of this chapter
      involving an alleged violation of any provision of any  such  regulation
      or order, the court shall stay the proceeding:
        (1)  During  the  period  within  which a petition may be filed in the
      supreme court pursuant to leave granted  under  subdivision  c  of  this
      section with respect to such provision;
        (2)  During  the  pendency of any protest properly filed under section
      26-410 of this chapter prior to the institution of the proceeding  under
      subdivision  ten  of  section  one  of the state enabling act or section
      26-413 of this chapter, setting forth objections to the validity of such
      provision which the court finds to have been made in good faith; and
        (3) During the pendency of any judicial proceeding instituted  by  the
      defendant  under this section with respect to such protest or instituted
      by the defendant under subdivision c of this  section  with  respect  to
      such  provision,  and  until  the expiration of the time allowed in this
      section for the taking of further proceedings with respect thereto.
        e. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision d  of  this  section,
      stays  shall  be  granted  thereunder  in  civil  proceedings only after
      judgment and upon application made  within  five  days  after  judgment.
      Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision d of this section, in the
      case of a proceeding under paragraph (a) of subdivision ten  of  section
      one of the state enabling act or subdivision a of section 26-413 of this
      chapter,  the  court granting a stay under subdivision d of this section
      shall issue a temporary injunction or  restraining  order  enjoining  or
      restraining,  during the period of the stay, violations by the defendant
      of any provision of the regulation or order involved in the  proceeding.
      If any provision of a regulation or order is determined to be invalid by
    
      judgment  of  the supreme court which has become effective in accordance
      with subdivision b of this section, any proceeding pending in any  court
      shall  be dismissed, and any judgment in such proceeding vacated, to the
      extent  that such proceeding or judgment is based upon violation of such
      provision. Except as provided in subdivisions c and d  of  this  section
      and  as  heretofore  provided in this subdivision e, the pendency of any
      protest under section 26-410 of this chapter before the city rent agency
      or judicial proceeding under this section,  shall  not  be  grounds  for
      staying  any  proceeding  brought pursuant to subdivision ten of section
      one of the state enabling act or section 26-413 of  this  chapter;  nor,
      except  as  provided in this subdivision e, shall any retroactive effect
      be given to any judgment setting aside a provision of  a  regulation  or
      order.
        f.  The  method  prescribed  herein  for  the  judicial  review  of  a
      regulation or order of the city rent agency shall be exclusive.

Section 26-412 ::    
        
     
        §  26-412  Prohibitions.  a.  It  shall be unlawful, regardless of any
      contract, lease or other  obligation  heretofore  or  hereafter  entered
      into,  for  any  person  to  demand  or receive any rent for any housing
      accommodations in excess of  the  applicable  maximum  rent  established
      therefor  by  the  city rent agency or otherwise to do or omit to do any
      act, in violation of any regulation, order or requirement  of  the  city
      rent  agency  under  the state enabling act or under this chapter, or to
      offer, solicit, attempt or agree to do any of the foregoing.
        b. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to  remove
      from  any  housing  accommodations  the tenant or occupant thereof or to
      refuse  to  renew  the  lease  or  agreement  for  the   use   of   said
      accommodations,  because  such tenant or occupant has taken, or proposes
      to take, action authorized or required by the state rent act or by  this
      chapter or any provision of this code, the multiple dwelling law, or the
      health  code  of  the  city  of  New  York,  or any regulation, order or

      agency or for any official adviser or consultant to the city rent agency
      to  disclose,  otherwise  than  in  the  course  of  official  duty, any
      information obtained under this chapter, or to use any such  information
      for personal benefit.
        d.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for  any person, with intent to cause any
      tenant to vacate housing accommodations or to  surrender  or  waive  any
      rights  of such tenant under this chapter or the regulations promulgated

      the  comfort, repose, peace or quiet of such tenant in his or her use or
      occupancy of the housing accommodations.
        e. It shall be unlawful for any person to make any statement or  entry

      or  to  wilfully omit or neglect to make any material statement or entry
      required to be made in any such document or report;
        f. It shall be unlawful for a landlord or a successor in  interest  to
      use  housing  accommodations  or the site on which same were located for

Section 26-413
--------------

Section 26-413 ::    
        
     
        §  26-413  Enforcement  and  penalties.  a.  Any  person  who wilfully
      violates any provision of section 26-412 of this chapter shall be guilty
      of and punishable for a crime as specified in subdivision ten of section
      one of the state enabling act, namely such persons shall be subject to a
      fine of not more than five thousand dollars, or to imprisonment for  not
      more  than  two  years  in  the  case of a violation of subdivision c of
      section 26-412 of this chapter and for not more than  one  year  in  all
      other cases, or to both such fine and imprisonment. The city rent agency
      may  certify such facts, which in its opinion constitute such violation,
      to the district attorney having jurisdiction thereof.
        b. (1) The city rent agency may, whenever in its judgment  any  person
      has  engaged  in  or  is  about  to  engage  in  acts or practices which
      constitute a violation of  any  provision  of  section  26-412  of  this
      chapter, apply to the supreme court for an order (a) enjoining such acts
      or  practices,  (b)  enforcing  compliance  with  such provision of said
      section or with an  order  issued  by  the  city  rent  agency,  or  (c)
      directing  the landlord to correct such violation of such provision; and
      upon sufficient showing, the supreme court  may  issue  a  temporary  or
      permanent  injunction,  restraining  order  or other order, all of which
      shall be granted without bond. Jurisdiction shall not be deemed  lacking
      in  the  supreme  court  because  a defense is based upon an order of an
      inferior court.
        (2) The city rent agency may, whenever in its judgment any person  has
      engaged  in  acts  or  practices  which  constitute  a  violation of any
      provision of section 26-412 of this chapter:
        * (a) Impose by administrative order after hearing,  a  civil  penalty
      for any violation of said section and bring an action to recover same in
      any  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  Such  penalty in the case of a
      violation of subdivision d of such section shall be in the amount of two
      thousand dollars for the first offense and ten thousand dollars for each
      subsequent offense or for a violation consisting of conduct directed  at
      the  tenants  of more than one housing accommodation; and in the case of
      any other violation of such  section  in  the  amount  of  one  thousand
      dollars  for  the  first  such offense and two thousand dollars for each
      subsequent offense. Such order by the city rent agency shall be deemed a
      final determination for the purposes of judicial review as  provided  in
      section  26-411  of this chapter. Such action shall be brought on behalf
      of the city and any  amount  recovered  shall  be  paid  into  the  city
      treasury.  Such right of action may be released, compromised or adjusted
      by the city rent agency at any time subsequent to the issuance  of  such
      administrative order.
        * NB Effective until June 16, 2015
        * (a)  Impose  by  administrative order after hearing, a civil penalty
      for any violation of said section and bring an action to recover same in
      any court of competent jurisdiction. Such  penalty  in  the  case  of  a
      violation of subdivision d of such section shall be in the amount of two
      thousand  dollars  for a first such offense and ten thousand dollars for
      each subsequent  offense  or  for  a  violation  consisting  of  conduct
      directed  at  the tenants of more than one housing accommodation; and in
      the case of any other violation of such section in  the  amount  of  one
      thousand dollars for the first such offense and two thousand dollars for
      each  subsequent  offense.  Such  order by the city rent agency shall be
      deemed a final determination for the  purposes  of  judicial  review  as
      provided in section 26-411 of this chapter. Such action shall be brought
      on  behalf  of  the city and any amount recovered shall be paid into the
      city treasury. Such right of action  may  be  released,  compromised  or
      adjusted  by the city rent agency at any time subsequent to the issuance
      of such administrative order.
    
        * NB Effective June 16, 2015
        (b)  Commence  an  action  to  recover  damages,  as  provided  for in
      paragraph two of subdivision d of this section in the event that (i) the
      tenant has not previously commenced such an action as  therein  provided
      and  (ii)  more than six months have elapsed since the occurrence of the
      violation or issuance of the order. An action  instituted  by  the  city
      rent agency shall constitute a bar to an action by the person aggrieved.
      The  city  rent  agency  shall pay over one-half of the sum recovered in
      such action to the person aggrieved and one-half to the  city  treasury,
      exclusive of costs and disbursements.
        (3)  (a)  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (b)  of this
      paragraph, make a finding  of  harassment  whenever  it  determines  the
      existence  of  a  violation  of  subdivision d of section 26-412 of this
      chapter in which event the city rent agency may (i) dismiss any  pending
      application  for  a  certificate  of  eviction  and grant any subsequent
      application for such certificate only upon such terms and conditions  as
      it deems necessary to prevent the circumvention or evasion of provisions
      of  this chapter; (ii) determine that such housing accommodations or any
      replacement or  subdivision  thereof  (whether  or  not  by  demolition,
      alteration  or  substantial  rehabilitation)  shall  constitute  housing
      accommodations subject to control under the provisions of this  chapter,
      notwithstanding  any  definition of that term to the contrary; and (iii)
      to refuse to credit any adjustments increasing rent mandated by  section
      26-405  of  this  chapter and dismiss any applications for an adjustment
      pursuant to said  section  for  such  time  and  under  such  terms  and
      conditions   as   the  city  rent  agency  deems  necessary  to  prevent
      circumvention or evasion of the provisions of this chapter.
        (b) No proceeding to determine  whether  housing  accommodations  have
      become  vacant  as  a  result  of harassment may be commenced later than
      thirty days after the entire structure shall have been  vacated,  unless
      the  landlord  failed  to certify his or her intent to alter or demolish
      the premises as provided by subdivision c  of  section  26-408  of  this
      chapter.  No  proceeding  shall be maintained for acts performed in good
      faith and  in  a  reasonable  manner  for  the  purposes  of  operating,
      maintaining  or  repairing  any  building  or part thereof. A finding of
      harassment shall be attached to and noted upon the registration  of  the
      housing  accommodations  affected  by  such findings, and a copy thereof
      shall be filed and docketed in the manner of a notice of mechanic's lien
      affecting the property. The provisions of this paragraph shall bind  all
      persons  or  parties  who  succeed  to  the  landlord's interest in said
      housing accommodations.
        (4) Revoke any order or determination  based  upon  any  statement  or
      entry  false in any material respect in any document or report submitted
      in any proceeding before the city rent agency or required to be kept  or
      filed under this chapter or any requirements thereunder.
        c. (1) Any court shall advance on the docket or otherwise expedite the
      disposition  of  any  action or proceeding brought before it pursuant to
      the provisions of subdivision b of this section.
        (2) The provisions of subdivision b of this  section  are  cumulative.
      The  enforcement  of one provision thereof shall not constitute a bar to
      the enforcement  by  action,  proceeding  or  by  making  a  finding  or
      determination pursuant to other provisions of said subdivision.
        (3)  The  city  rent  agency  may  direct that a refund payment to the
      tenant for rent collected in  violation  of  subdivision  a  of  section
      26-412 include interest from the date of each excessive payment of rent.
      Where  the  city  rent  agency  has  revoked  an  order or determination
      premised on a false statement or entry, it may withhold issuance  of  an
      order  granting increase in maximum rent for such housing accommodations
    
      until the landlord has complied  with  the  refund  directive,  if  any,
      provided for in such order of revocation.
        d.  (1)  Where after the city rent agency has granted a certificate of
      eviction authorizing the landlord to pursue his or her remedies pursuant
      to law to acquire possession and a tenant  voluntarily  removes  from  a
      housing  accommodation  or  has  been  removed  therefrom  by  action or
      proceeding  to  evict  from  or  recover   possession   of   a   housing
      accommodation  upon  the ground that the landlord seeks in good faith to
      recover possession of such accommodation:
        (a) For his or her immediate and personal use, or  for  the  immediate
      and  personal use by a member or members of his or her immediate family,
      and such landlord or members of his or her immediate family  shall  fail
      to  occupy  such  accommodation  within  thirty  days  after  the tenant
      vacates; or
        (b)  For  the  immediate   purpose   of   withdrawing   such   housing
      accommodation  from  the rental market, and such landlord shall lease or
      sell the housing accommodation or the space previously occupied thereby,
      or permit use thereof in  a  manner  other  than  contemplated  in  such
      eviction  certificate  within a period of one year after such removal of
      the tenant; or
        (c) For the immediate purpose of altering or remodeling  such  housing
      accommodation, and the landlord (who required possession for the purpose
      of effecting such alteration or remodeling) shall fail to start the work
      of  alteration or remodeling of such housing accommodation within ninety
      days after the removal of the last tenant whose removal is necessary  to
      enable  the  landlord  to  effect  such alteration or remodeling of such
      accommodation, or if after having commenced  such  work  shall  fail  or
      neglect to prosecute the work with reasonable diligence; or
        (d)   For   the   immediate   purpose   of  demolishing  such  housing
      accommodations and  constructing  a  new  building  in  accordance  with
      approved  plans,  or  reasonable amendment thereof, and the landlord has
      failed to complete the demolition within six months after the removal of
      the last tenant or,  having  demolished  the  premises,  has  failed  or
      neglected  to proceed with the new construction within ninety days after
      the completion of such demolition, or having commenced such construction
      work, has failed or neglected to prosecute  such  work  with  reasonable
      diligence; or
        (e)  For  some  purpose other than those specified above for which the
      removal of the tenant was sought and the landlord has failed to use  the
      vacated premises for such purposes; such landlord shall, unless for good
      cause  shown  be  liable  to  the  tenant  for  three  times the damages
      sustained on account of such removal plus reasonable attorney's fees and
      costs as determined by the court provided that the tenant commences such
      action within three years from the expiration  of  the  applicable  time
      period  as  set  forth in this subdivision. The damages sustained by the
      tenant under this subdivision shall be the difference between  the  rent
      paid  for  the housing accommodation from which such tenant was evicted,
      and the rental value of a comparable housing accommodation on  the  open
      market.  In  addition  to  any  other damage, the cost of removal of the
      tenant's property shall be a  lawful  measure  of  damages.  The  remedy
      herein   provided  shall  be  in  addition  to  those  provided  for  in
      subdivisions a and b of this section. Such acts  and  omissions  on  the
      part  of  a  landlord  after  issuance  of a certificate of eviction are
      hereby declared to be  consistent  with  the  purposes  for  which  such
      certificate of eviction was issued.
        (2)  A  tenant  may bring an action against his or her landlord in any
      court of competent jurisdiction for a  violation  of  subdivision  a  of
      section  26-412  of  this chapter within: (a) two years from the date of
    
      occurrence of an overcharge, defined to mean the  amount  by  which  the
      consideration  paid  by  a  tenant  to a landlord exceeds the applicable
      maximum rent, or (b) within one year after the landlord fails to  pay  a
      refund  as  ordered  by the city rent agency, such time to be calculated
      from thirty-three days after the date of the issuance of  the  order  or
      when  the order becomes final, whichever is later, or (c) in the case of
      an act proscribed by subdivision e of section 26-412  of  this  chapter,
      within  two  years  after  knowledge  of  such statement or omission and
      consequent violation has  been  made  known  to  the  city  agency.  The
      landlord  shall  be  liable  for reasonable attorney's fees and costs as
      determined by the court, plus whichever of the  following  sums  is  the
      greater:  (i)  such  amount  not more than three times the amount of the
      overcharge, or the overcharges, upon which the action is  based  as  the
      court  in  its  discretion may determine or (ii) an amount not less than
      twenty-five dollars, provided, however, that such amount  shall  be  the
      amount   of  the  overcharge  or  overcharges  or  twenty-five  dollars,
      whichever is greater, if the defendant proves that the violation of  the
      regulation  or  order  in  question was neither wilful nor the result of
      failure to take practicable precautions against the  occurrence  of  the
      violation.
        (3)  A tenant or occupant who is unlawfully removed by a landlord from
      any housing accommodation  may,  within  two  years  from  the  date  of
      occurrence,  bring a civil action against the landlord by reason of such
      unlawful removal. In such action, the landlord shall be  liable  to  the
      tenant  for three times the damages sustained on account of such removal
      plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined  by  the  court.
      The  damages  sustained  by the tenant under this paragraph shall be the
      difference between the rent paid  for  the  housing  accommodation  from
      which  such  tenant  was  evicted  and  the rental value of a comparable
      housing accommodation on the open  market.  In  addition  to  any  other
      damage  the  cost  of removal of the tenant's property shall be a lawful
      measure of damage.
        e. No person (including, but not limited to any officer or employee of
      the city rent agency) shall be held liable for damages or  penalties  in
      any  court, on any grounds for or in respect of anything done or omitted
      to be done in good faith pursuant to any provision of the state rent act
      or of this chapter, or any regulation, order, or requirement thereunder,
      notwithstanding that subsequently such provision, regulation,  order  or
      requirement  may be modified, rescinded, or determined to be invalid. In
      any action or proceeding wherein a party relies for ground of relief  or
      defense  or  raises  issue  or  brings into question the construction or
      validity of any provision of this chapter or any regulation,  order,  or
      requirement  thereunder, the court having jurisdiction of such action or
      proceeding may at any stage certify such fact to the city  rent  agency.
      The city rent agency may intervene in any such action or proceeding.
