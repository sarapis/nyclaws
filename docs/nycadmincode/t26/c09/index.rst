      appraiser that was selected by the owner and the appraiser  selected  by
      the  tenant  association,  or if applicable, a qualified entity, if such
      condition is deemed acceptable to the owner and the tenants association,

      that  failed  to select an appraiser. In such circumstance, the cost for
      the appraiser selected by the department shall be  borne  by  the  party

      advisory panel, the owner and the tenant association, or if  applicable,
      a  qualified entity, may in writing apply to the department for a waiver
      from subdivisions a through d of this section. The department shall make
      a determination upon such application for a waiver within  fifteen  days

Section 26-813 ::    
        
     
        § 26-813  Judicial  Review.  Any  person  aggrieved  by  an  appraisal
      determination made pursuant to section 26-804 of this chapter, or by the
      failure of the department to approve a bona fide offer to purchase, may,
      within thirty days of the  appraisal  determination  or  action  by  the
      department,  seek  judicial  review pursuant to article seventy-eight of
      the civil practice law and rules in the supreme court for the county  in
      which  the assisted rental housing is located. In the event that a court
      may find that the appraisal or action by the department constitutes  the
      equivalent  of  a  taking  without  just  compensation,  the court shall
      require that a new appraisal or determination be made. The time  periods
      set  forth in this chapter shall be tolled during the pendency of such a
      proceeding and until a new appraisal or  determination,  if  needed,  is
