      violations.

      enforce such orders.
        (4)  A closing directed by the department pursuant to paragraph one of
      this subdivision shall not constitute an act of possession, ownership or
      control by the city of the closed premises.
        (5) Mutilation or removal of a posted order of the commissioner or his
      designee shall be punishable by a fine of  not  more  than  two  hundred
      fifty  dollars  or  by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days, or both,
