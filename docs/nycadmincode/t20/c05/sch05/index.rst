      shall  disclose  in  such  advertising,  in  accordance  with  the rules
      established by the commissioner, in clear and prominent letter type,  in
      a  print  color  that  contrasts  with  the  background against which it
      appears:

      related to the distressed home loan, the property, or the potential loss

      foreclosure  process, nor can a distressed property consultant guarantee
      any particular result with regards to a distressed property.

      provides  for  a right or rights of renewal for one or more periods upon
      the same terms and conditions or terms and conditions set forth in  such
      agreement, the holder who is a party to such agreement or any agreements
      entered  into  pursuant  to  such  right  or  rights of renewal shall be
      subject to the requirements of this section at the commencement  of  the
      first renewal period.
        e.  (1)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law, the department
      shall be authorized  upon  due  notice  and  hearing,  to  impose  civil
      penalties  for  the  violation  of  any  provision  of this section. The

      notices of violation. The notice of  violation  or  copy  thereof  shall
      constitute  notice  of  the  violation  charged,  and,  if  sworn  to or
