Section 20-224 ::    
        
     
        § 20-224 License required.  a. Any person owning, leasing, managing or
      operating  a  restaurant  under permit from the department of health and
      mental hygiene upon property which abuts upon any street within the city
      may maintain or operate upon the sidewalk of  such  street  in  an  area
      immediately  adjacent  to  its  premises, a sidewalk cafe, provided that
      such sidewalk cafe shall be granted a license and a revocable consent by
      the commissioner.
        b. The commissioner, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter
      and the applicable provisions of the zoning resolution, shall  establish
      such  rules, regulations, terms and conditions as the commissioner deems
      proper in respect to the granting and  issuance  of  such  licenses  and
      revocable  consents,  priorities  or  rights  between  applicants  for a
      license covering the same  space,  and  operation  (including  hours  of
      operation,  provided  that  no  such rule, regulation, term or condition
      shall prevent licensed sidewalk cafes from operating during the hours of
      10:00 a.m. through 12:00 a.m. daily or  shall  allow  licensed  sidewalk
      cafes  to  operate  before 10:00 a.m. on Sundays) and maintenance of any
      sidewalk cafe, to ensure good order and to prevent undue obstruction  of
      the sidewalk, which shall have the force and effect of law. A license to
      operate a sidewalk cafe shall be issued after the review and approval of
      a  petition  for  a  revocable  consent  to  construct  and operate such
      sidewalk cafe pursuant to the provisions of section  20-225,  20-226  or
      20-227 of this subchapter. The operator of a sidewalk cafe under license
      from the commissioner shall cause the boundary of the area licensed as a
      sidewalk   cafe  to  be  marked  in  a  manner  prescribed  under  rules
      promulgated by the commissioner.
        c. No license shall be granted for an enclosed sidewalk cafe until  an
      alteration  permit  or  any  other  required  permit  is  issued  by the
      department of buildings. No license shall be granted for a sidewalk cafe
      located in a historic district,  on  a  landmark  site  or  attached  or
      adjacent to a landmark or an improvement containing an interior landmark
      without  the required approval of the landmarks preservation commission.
      No license shall be granted for an unenclosed cafe which  obstructs  the
      means  of  egress  from any portion of a building nor for any unenclosed
      cafe with an awning unless a permit therefor is issued by the department
      of buildings.
        d. The fee for such license shall be at the rate of five  hundred  and
      ten  dollars  for  a  two-year  license.  Such  license  fee shall be in
      addition to any fee imposed, pursuant to rules of the commissioner, upon
      approval of a petition for a revocable consent, or  a  renewal  of  such
      revocable consent, to construct and operate a sidewalk cafe or any other
      applicable fee.
        e.  A  licensee  must provide waiter or waitress service to patrons in
      the sidewalk cafe if alcohol is served. If no alcohol is served  at  the
      restaurant,  a licensee must provide adequate service to maintain tables
      in the sidewalk cafe and the adjacent sidewalk in a manner that  ensures
      good order and cleanliness.
        f. The license shall be personal to the applicant and may not be sold,
      leased  or  transferred  and  shall  be  deemed  revoked  by the sale or
      transfer of the lease or of title to the building or structure to  which
      the sidewalk cafe is related.

Section 20-225 ::    
        
     
        §  20-225  Review  and approval of petitions for revocable consents to
      construct and operate enclosed  sidewalk  cafes  which  do  not  require
      special  permits.  A  petition  for a revocable consent to construct and
      operate an enclosed sidewalk cafe  which  does  not  require  a  special
      permit  modification pursuant to the zoning resolution shall be reviewed
      and approved in the following manner:
        a. The petition shall be in such form as prescribed by the department.
      The petition shall be filed with the department which, within five  days
      of  the  filing  of  such  petition, shall forward copies thereof to the
      department of city planning, the department of environmental  protection
      and  the  landmarks  preservation  commission  for  review  pursuant  to
      subdivision b of this section. The department shall  forward  copies  of
      the  petition,  within  five days of the filing of such petition, to the
      speaker of the council and to the council member in whose  district  the
      cafe is proposed to be located, for informational purposes.
        b.  The agencies to which the petition has been forwarded shall review
      the petition  and  shall  indicate  any  objections  to  such  petition,
      including  any  determination  by  the landmarks preservation commission
      that the petition requires a certificate of appropriateness,  by  filing
      written  comments with the department of city planning within twenty-one
      days of the receipt thereof. The failure of an agency  to  indicate  its
      objections within the prescribed time to the department of city planning
      shall be construed to mean that such agency has no objections.
        c.  If  no objections to such petition are filed within the twenty-one
      day period prescribed in subdivision b of this section,  the  department
      of  city  planning shall forward the petition within five days after the
      close of such period to the community board for the  community  district
      in which the cafe is proposed to be located, and such board shall review
      such petition pursuant to subdivision e of this section.
        d. If any objections exist, including any objections by the department
      of  city  planning,  the  department  of  city planning shall inform the
      petitioner of the objections and that review of the  petition  has  been
      stayed  until  the  objections indicated are resolved. If the objections
      are not resolved within six months  from  the  date  the  petitioner  is
      informed  that  review  of  the  petition has been stayed, such petition
      shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. If the objections  are  resolved
      within  the  prescribed  time,  the  department  of  city planning shall
      forward the petition within five days of such resolution to the  council
      member  in  whose district the cafe is proposed to be located and to the
      community board for the community district in which the cafe is proposed
      to be located, and such board shall  review  the  petition  pursuant  to
      subdivision e of this section.
        e.  The  community  board  shall, not later than forty-five days after
      receipt of such petition, either (i) notify the public of  the  petition
      in  a manner specified by the city planning commission, conduct a public
      hearing thereon and submit a written recommendation  to  the  department
      and  to  the  council  or  (ii)  waive by a written statement its public
      hearing and recommendation on such petition, and submit  such  statement
      to the department and to the council.
        f.  Within  thirty  days  after  the  expiration of the forty-five day
      period allowed for the filing of  a  recommendation  or  waiver  by  the
      community  board,  the department shall (i) hold a public hearing on the
      petition, (ii) approve the petition, disapprove it or  approve  it  with
      modifications,  and  (iii)  file  with  the council any such decision to
      approve or approve with modifications, together with  the  petition.  If
      within  the  time  period  provided,  the  department  fails to take the
      actions on a petition  provided  for  in  the  preceding  sentence,  the
      petition  shall  be deemed to have been denied. For a period of not less
    
      than fifteen calendar days prior to the date of such public hearing, the
      petitioner  shall  post  notice  of  the  public  hearing  in  a   place
      conspicuous  to  public  view  at  the location of the proposed sidewalk
      cafe.  At  least  fifteen  days  prior  to the date of such hearing, the
      department shall give notice to the community board for the district  in
      which  the  cafe  is  proposed  to  be  located, to the president of the

      revocable consents for sidewalk cafes.
        g.  Within  twenty  days  of  the date the petition is received by the
      council pursuant to subdivision f  of  this  section,  the  council  may
      resolve  by  the  majority  vote  of  all  council members to review the
      petition. If the council does  not  so  resolve,  the  approval  of  the
      petition  by the department shall be forwarded to the mayor for approval
      pursuant to subdivision i of this section.
        h.  If  the  council  resolves  to  review  a  petition  pursuant   to
      subdivision  g of this section, the council shall hold a public hearing,
      after giving public notice not less than five days in  advance  of  such
      hearing.  The  council shall take final action on the petition and shall

      pursuant  to  subdivision  f  of this section. The affirmative vote of a
      majority of all the  council  members  shall  be  required  to  approve,
      approve with modifications or disapprove the petition. Any modifications
      by  the  council  shall  not  affect the terms of any proposed revocable
      consent agreement which  relate  to  term,  compensation,  revocability,
      exclusivity, security, insurance, indemnification, erection, maintenance
      or  removal  of any structure, right of access by the city and rights of
      abutting property owners. If within the time period provided for in this
      subdivision, the council fails to act or fails to act  by  the  required
      vote  on  a  petition,  the council shall be deemed to have approved the
      petition.
        i. The consent shall be for such term and upon such conditions as  may
      be  provided  in the approval of the petition by the department, as such
      approval  may  be  modified  by  action  of  the  council  pursuant   to
      subdivision h of this section, but shall be revocable at any time by the
      department.  The  separate and additional approval of the mayor shall be
      necessary to its validity.
        j. Consents for sidewalk cafes shall  provide  for  fees  to  be  paid
      annually  to  the  city during the continuance of the consent. Such fees
      shall be calculated pursuant to a formula  established  by  rule  or  by
      local  law,  which  shall  apply  uniformly to all consents for enclosed
      sidewalk cafes. The department shall file with  the  council  a  written
      recommendation for a formula to be used to calculate such fees.

Section 20-227.1.
-----------------

Section 20-227.1. ::    
        
     
        § 20-227.1. a. Any person found to be operating an unlicensed sidewalk
      cafe shall be liable for a civil penalty of at least two hundred and not
      more  than  one  thousand  dollars for the first violation, at least two
      hundred and not more than  one  thousand  dollars  for  each  additional
      violation  occurring  on the same day; and at least five hundred and not
      more than two  thousand  dollars  for  the  second  violation  and  each
      subsequent  violation  at  the  same place of business within a two-year
      period. For purposes of this section, any  violation  for  operating  an
      unlicensed  sidewalk cafe shall be included in determining the number of
      violations by any  subsequent  license  holder  at  the  same  place  of
      business  unless  the  subsequent license holder provides the department
      with adequate documentation demonstrating that  the  subsequent  license
      holder  acquired  the  premises  or  business  through  an  arm's length
      transaction as defined in subdivision f of this  section  and  that  the
      sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of
      permitting the original license holder to avoid the effect of violations
      on the premises.
        b.  Any  holder  of a license found to be operating a sidewalk cafe in
      violation of this subchapter, the terms and conditions of  such  license
      and/or  a  revocable  consent  or  rules promulgated by the commissioner
      pursuant to this subchapter, shall be liable for a civil penalty  of  at
      least  two  hundred and not more than one thousand dollars for the first
      violation, at least two hundred and not more than one  thousand  dollars
      for  each  additional  violation occurring on the same day; and at least
      five hundred and not more than  two  thousand  dollars  for  the  second
      violation,  and  at  least  one thousand and not more than four thousand
      dollars for each subsequent violation at  the  same  place  of  business
      within  a  two-year period. In addition, for a third violation occurring
      on a different day and all subsequent violations occurring on  different
      days  at the same place of business within a two-year period, any person
      licensed to operate a sidewalk cafe at such place of business  shall  be
      subject  to suspension or revocation of his or her sidewalk cafe license
      for such place of business. For  purposes  of  this  section,  any  such
      violation by any license holder at a place of business shall be included
      in determining the number of violations by any subsequent license holder
      at  the  same  place  of  business  unless the subsequent license holder
      provides the department with adequate documentation  demonstrating  that
      the  subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business through
      an arm's length transaction as defined in subdivision f of this  section
      and  that  the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for
      the purpose of permitting the  original  license  holder  to  avoid  the
      effect  of  violations on the premises. A sidewalk cafe license shall be
      suspended or revoked at the same hearing at  which  a  person  is  found
      liable  for a third violation or subsequent violations at the same place
      of business within a two-year period.
        c. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty  authorized  pursuant  to
      the provisions of subdivisions a or b of this section shall be commenced
      by  service  of  a  notice of violation which shall be returnable to the
      adjudication division of the department. Such  notice  shall  contain  a
      statement   that  any  hearing  for  a  third  violation  or  subsequent
      violations of this subchapter, the terms and  conditions  of  a  license
      and/or  a  revocable  consent  or  rules promulgated by the commissioner
      under this subchapter at the same place of business  within  a  two-year
      period  shall also constitute a hearing for the suspension or revocation
      of a license.
        d. The penalties provided by subdivisions a  and  b  of  this  section
      shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed by any other provision
      of law or rule promulgated thereunder.
    
        e.  In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by this
      subchapter or any other provision of law or rule, the commissioner after
      notice and a hearing shall be authorized to order that any sidewalk cafe
      and the restaurant of which it is a portion be sealed for a  period  not
      to  exceed  thirty  consecutive  days.  Such notice may be included with
      notice of any hearing for a second violation for operating an unlicensed
      sidewalk cafe as provided in subdivision a of this section, or  a  third
      violation  of  this  subchapter,  the  terms and conditions of a license
      and/or a revocable consent or rules promulgated by the commissioner,  as
      provided  in  subdivision  b  of  this  section.  For  purposes  of this
      subdivision, any such  violations  at  a  place  of  business  shall  be
      included  in  determining  the  number  of  violations by any subsequent
      license holder at the same  place  of  business  unless  the  subsequent
      license  holder  provides  the  department  with  adequate documentation
      demonstrating that the subsequent license holder acquired  the  premises
      or   business   through  an  arm's  length  transaction  as  defined  in
      subdivision f of this section  and  that  the  sale  or  lease  was  not
      conducted,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  the purpose of permitting the
      original license holder  to  avoid  the  effect  of  violations  on  the
      premises.  The procedures provided for in subdivisions c and e through j
      of section 20-105  of  this  title  shall  apply  to  an  order  by  the
      commissioner  for sealing of a sidewalk cafe and the restaurant of which
      it is a portion.
        f. For purposes of this section, "arm's length  transaction"  means  a
      sale  of  a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of
      any part thereof, or a sale  of  a  business,  in  good  faith  and  for
      valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real
      property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed
      and   willing   parties,  where  neither  is  under  any  compulsion  to
      participate in the transaction, unaffected  by  any  unusual  conditions
      indicating  a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for
      the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the  effect  of
      violations  on  the  premises.  The  following  sales or leases shall be
      presumed  not  to  be  arm's   length   transactions   unless   adequate
      documentation  is  provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not
      conducted, in whole or in  part,  for  the  purpose  of  permitting  the
      original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises:
        (1) a sale between relatives;
        (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
        (3)  a  sale  or  lease  affected by other facts or circumstances that
      would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into  for  the  primary
      purpose  of  permitting  the  original  licensee  to avoid the effect of
      violations on the premises,
        g. Notwithstanding the provisions of  subdivisions  a  or  b  of  this
      section,  the  suspension  or  revocation  of a license for a subsequent
      offense shall be waived if, upon the submission of  satisfactory  proof,
      the commissioner determines that the person or persons who committed the
      violations  which  are  the basis for the suspension or revocation acted
      against the licensee's will in committing such violations.
