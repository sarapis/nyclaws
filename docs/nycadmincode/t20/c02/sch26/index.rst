Section 20-433
--------------

Section 20-433 ::    
        
     
        §  20-433 Short title. This subchapter shall be known and may be cited
      as the New York city games of chance licensing law.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 20-434
--------------

Section 20-434 ::    
        
     
        §  20-434  Legislative  intent.  The  council hereby declares that the
      raising of funds for the promotion of bona fide charitable, educational,
      scientific, health, religious, and patriotic  causes  and  undertakings,
      where  the beneficiaries are undetermined, is in the public interest. It
      hereby  finds  that,  as  conducted  prior  to  the  enactment  of  this
      subchapter,  games  of  chance  were  the  subject  of  exploitation  by
      professional gamblers, promoters and commercial interests. It is  hereby
      declared to be the policy of the council that all phases of supervision,
      licensing  and regulation of games of chance and the conduct of games of
      chance should  be  closely  controlled  and  that  the  local  laws  and
      regulations  pertaining thereto should be strictly construed and rigidly
      enforced; that the conduct of the games  and  all  attendant  activities
      should  be  so  regulated  and  adequate  controls  so  instituted as to
      discourage commercialization in all its forms, including the  rental  of
      commercial  premises  for  games  of  chance,  and  to  ensure a maximum
      availability of the net proceeds of  games  of  chance  exclusively  for
      application to the worthy causes and undertakings specified herein; that
      the only justification for this subchapter is to foster and support such
      worthy  causes and undertakings, and that the mandate of section nine of
      article one of the state constitution, as amended, and of article nine-A
      of the general municipal law, should be carried out by rigid regulations
      to prevent commercialized gambling, prevent  participation  by  criminal
      and  other  undesirable elements and prevent the diversion of funds from
      the purposes herein authorized.
