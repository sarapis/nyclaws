      may  refuse  to  issue  a  license required under this subchapter, for a
      period of two years after such revocation, for such place of business or

      license  holder  at a place of business shall be included in determining

      commissioner   with   adequate   documentation  demonstrating  that  the
      subsequent license holder acquired the premises or business  through  an
      arm's  length  transaction and that the sale or lease was not conducted,

      between  two  informed  and  willing parties, where neither is under any
      compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any  unusual
      conditions  indicating  a  reasonable possibility that the sale or lease
      was made for the purpose of permitting the original  licensee  to  avoid
      the  effect of violations on the premises. The following sales or leases
      shall be presumed not to be arm's length  transactions  unless  adequate
      documentation  is  provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not

           (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
           (3)  a  sale or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that
           would indicate that the sale or  lease  is  entered  into  for  the
           primary  purpose  of  permitting the original licensee to avoid the
           effect of violations on the premises, or revocation of a license.
