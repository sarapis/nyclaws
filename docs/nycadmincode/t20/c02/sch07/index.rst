      transportation.
        d. 1. No license issued under section 20-229 shall be renewed  if  the
      department  of  transportation determines that the newsstand so licensed
      poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians at  the
      time of review.
        2.  On  and  after  the effective date of the local law that adds this
      paragraph two to this subdivision d of this section, a  newsstand  shall
      not be eligible for a renewal if the area of the sidewalk occupied by it
      exceeds  seventy-two  square feet or such newsstand exceeds nine feet in
      height.
        (a) On and after such date, such newsstand that was first licensed  on
      or  after the first day of August, nineteen hundred ninety-one shall not
      pose an obstruction to the free use of the sidewalks by  pedestrians  if
      the location of such newsstand does not
        (i) reduce the area maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement
      below a width of nine and one-half feet.
        (ii) place the proposed newsstand within five feet of a fire hydrant.
        (iii)  create a level of service at the proposed location for the peak
      fifteen minutes of the peak hour of a pedestrian flow rate equal  to  or

      determined by the department of transportation.
        (iv) place the proposed newsstand within fifteen feet of  an  entrance
      to or exit from a subway.
        (v)  extend into the area encompassed by the extension of the property
      lines from the buildings to the curb at the intersection of two  streets
      and the area ten feet on either side of such lines.
        (vi) extend into a bus stop.
        (vii)  otherwise  create  a  hazardous condition. For purposes of this
      subparagraph, a hazardous condition shall include, but  not  be  limited
      to,  the location of a newsstand less than one foot, six inches from the
      curb, under a fire escape, within ten feet of a driveway or parking  lot
      or  within  two  feet  from  underground  access points, such as utility

        (b) On and after such date, a newsstand that was first licensed  prior
      to  the  first day of August, nineteen hundred ninety-one shall not pose
      an obstruction to the free use of the sidewalks by  pedestrians  if  the
      location of such newsstand does not
        (i) reduce the area maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement
      below a width of nine and one-half feet.
        (ii) place the proposed newsstand within five feet of a fire hydrant.
        (iii)  create a level of service at the proposed location for the peak

      determined by the department of transportation.
        (iv) violate  the  restrictions  on  the  location  of  newsstands  in

      or side of a subway entrance or exit kiosk.
    
        (v) extend into the area encompassed by the extension of the  property
      lines from the buildings to the curb at the intersection of two streets.
        (vi)  otherwise  create  a  hazardous  condition. For purposes of this
      subparagraph, a hazardous condition shall include, but  not  be  limited
      to,  the location of a newsstand less than one foot, six inches from the
      curb, under a fire escape, within ten feet of a driveway or parking  lot
      or  within  two  feet  from  underground  access points, such as utility
      access openings, ventilation grills, or cellar doors.
        e. No newsstand shall occupy an area of more than  seventy-two  square
      feet  or  have  a  height of over nine feet. However, any newsstand that
      occupied an area of more than seventy-two square feet on the  first  day
      of  August, nineteen hundred seventy-nine may continue to operate within
      that area until the thirty-first day of July, nineteen  hundred  eighty.
      In  no  event shall there be less than a width of nine and one-half feet
      maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian  movement.  The  provision  of
      this  section  requiring  that  no  less  than nine and one-half feet be
      maintained on the sidewalk for pedestrian movement shall  not  apply  to
      any  newsstand  which  was first licensed by the department prior to the
      first day of August, nineteen hundred seventy-nine where the person  who
      held the license for such newsstand on the first day of August, nineteen
      hundred  ninety-one  continues  to  be  the licensee for such newsstand;
      provided, however, that where a newsstand which was first licensed prior
      to  the  first  day  of  August,  nineteen   hundred   seventy-nine   is
      reconstructed   in   its   entirety   or   in  substantial  part,  which
      reconstruction was commenced on  or  after  the  first  day  of  August,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-one,  such  newsstand shall be subject to such
      requirement that no less than nine and one-half feet  be  maintained  on
      the sidewalk for pedestrian movement.
        f. Stands at subway entrance or exit kiosks shall be maintained at the
      rear  or side of such kiosks. Where such stand is located at the rear of
      such entrance or exit it shall not be located within fifteen feet of the
      front of any other entrance or exit and shall not  be  longer  than  the
      width of the kiosk nor occupy an area of more than fifty square feet.
        g.  It shall be unlawful to erect a stand or booth under the stairs of
      an elevated railway station, or a projection therefrom, which  is  wider
      than  the  width  of  the  stairs  or which extends along the sidewalk a
      greater distance than to a point where  the  undersurface  is  not  over
      seven feet from the level of the sidewalk.
        h.   1.  After  November  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine,  no
      newsstand may be operated unless its design has been approved by the art
      commission. The art  commission  shall  evaluate  newsstand  designs  in
      conformity  with  guidelines  to  be  established  by  the department of
      consumer affairs. Approval or disapproval of a design  submission  shall
      be  issued  within  thirty  days  of  filing  an  application  with  the
      commission.
        2. The department of transportation shall  develop  criteria  for  the
      design  of  the  interior  of  newsstands constructed and installed by a
      franchisee pursuant  to  a  franchise  in  consultation  with  available
      representatives  of newsstand licensees and available representatives of
      publishers.
        i. No advertising shall be placed on any newsstand other than exterior
      advertising placed by a franchisee. Nothing herein shall be construed to
      prohibit or limit the ability of the newsstand licensee to display legal
      merchandise pursuant to rules promulgated by the department.
        j.  The  licensee  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  maintain  the
      cleanliness  of his or her newsstand. Such requirement shall not include
      an obligation to maintain the exterior of a structure installed pursuant
    
      to a franchise. The licensee shall make no alteration in the  design  or
      dimensions of a newsstand constructed or installed by a franchisee.
        k.  1.  On and after the grant of a franchise, no new license shall be
      granted except for operation of a  newsstand  installed  and  maintained
      pursuant  to  such  franchise,  and  approval  of  the location of a new
      newsstand  shall  be  made  by  the  department  of  transportation   in
      accordance with rules of the department.
        2.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this section or the second
      undesignated paragraph of section 15-205 of the code, a  newsstand,  the
      location  or dimensions of which were not in violation of the provisions
      of this section or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto at the date  of
      the  grant  of  a franchise and which complies with all of the terms and
      conditions of such franchise, may be reconstructed at such  location  by
      such  franchisee  if such reconstruction does not change the location of
      such newsstand or expand the area occupied by  such  newsstand  for  any
      reason,  including  compliance with the requirements of any provision of
      law  in  effect  at  the  time  of  such  reconstruction,  such  as  the
      requirements   of   the   Americans   with  Disabilities  Act.  If  such
      reconstruction results in a change in location or an  expansion  of  the
      area  occupied by such newsstand, such newsstand may be reconstructed at
      such changed or expanded location if that  location  complies  with  the
      siting  criteria  applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license of such
      newsstand in subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph two of  subdivision  d
      of  this  section.  If  such  reconstruction  at such location would not
      comply with such criteria, such newsstand may be relocated in accordance
      with the process defined in paragraph five  of  this  subdivision  to  a
      location  that  meets the criteria in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph
      two.
        3. On or after the grant of such franchise, any newsstand applying for
      renewal  of  a  license  issued  pursuant  to  section  20-229  of  this
      subchapter  may  remain  at  its  then  current location if it meets the
      siting criteria applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license  of  such
      newsstand  in  subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph two of subdivision d
      of this section, or, if such location does not meet such criteria,  such
      newsstand  may  be  relocated  in accordance with the process defined in
      paragraph five of this subdivision to a location that meets the criteria
      in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph two.
        4. On or  after  the  grant  of  such  franchise,  the  department  of
      transportation  shall  not exercise its authority, by granting revocable
      consents  or  other  approvals,  to  authorize  the  installation  of  a
      structure  at  a  location  that would render the location of a licensed
      newsstand in violation of the siting criteria applicable to the  renewal
      of  licenses in subparagraph (a) or (b), as applicable to the renewal of
      the license of such newsstand, of paragraph two of subdivision d of this
      section unless the commissioner  of  such  department  finds  that  such
      installation  is  for  the  benefit of public health, safety, welfare or
      convenience. In the event the installation of a structure not prohibited
      by this paragraph four causes the location  of  a  newsstand  to  be  in
      violation  of such criteria, such newsstand may be relocated pursuant to
      the process defined in paragraph five of this subdivision to a  location
      that meets the criteria in subparagraph (a) of such paragraph two.
        5.  (a)  On  or  after the grant of such a franchise, a newsstand, the
      location of which fails to meet the siting criteria  applicable  to  the
      renewal  of  the license of such newsstand in subparagraph (a) or (b) of
      paragraph two of subdivision d of this section shall cease operation and
      shall be removed  from  such  location.  A  newsstand  required  by  the
      provisions  of  this  paragraph  to  be  relocated  at any time shall be
      eligible to be relocated to a site within a radius of five hundred  feet
    
      from  such  licensed  location,  referred  to  in  this  section  as the
      "catchment area", provided such site is identified by the  licensee  and
      meets  the  siting  criteria  applicable  to  the renewal of licenses in
      subparagraph  (a)  of  paragraph  two  of subdivision d of this section.
      Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of  this  subparagraph  (a)  of
      this paragraph five, a newsstand, the license for which is in full force
      and  effect,  shall  not  be  required  to  be replaced before September
      thirtieth, two thousand six, if the replacement  of  such  newsstand  is
      required  to occupy an expanded area solely because of the provisions of
      the Americans with  Disabilities  Act,  and  the  installation  of  such
      newsstand  at  such expanded location would not meet the siting criteria
      applicable  to  the  renewal  of  the  license  of  such  newsstand   in
      subparagraph (a) or (b) of such paragraph two.
        (b)  If  the  department of transportation determines that there is no
      site within such catchment area to which a newsstand may be relocated in
      accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph five, the licensee of
      such newsstand may apply for a license for a new newsstand in accordance
      with the applicable provisions of this subchapter.
        6. The department of transportation shall conduct an inspection at the
      time of  the  reconstruction  and  installation  of  a  newsstand  by  a
      franchisee  in  accordance  with  paragraph  two of this subdivision. In
      addition, such department shall conduct inspections of all newsstands in
      the year two thousand eight and every six years thereafter to  determine
      whether  the  location for which each newsstand is licensed violates any
      laws, rules or regulations applicable to the review by  such  department
      of  applications  for  the renewal of licenses, notwithstanding that the
      term of such licenses is two years, and, except for determinations  made
      pursuant  to  inspections  made in accordance with such paragraph two of
      this subdivision at the time of the reconstruction and installation of a
      newsstand by a franchisee, the determination  by  such  department  that
      there is no such violation shall not be revised, except for a mistake of
      fact, by such department until such six year period has elapsed.

        §  20-237  Stoop line stands; restrictions. a. Stoop line stands shall
      not exceed seven feet  in  height.  Every  stoop  line  stand  shall  be

      use of the sidewalk by pedestrians. Stoop line stands shall  not  exceed
      ten  feet  in  length  nor  four  feet  in  width, except as provided in

Section 20-239 ::    
        
     
        § 20-239 Approval. A stoop line stand shall not be licensed unless the
      location  thereof has been approved by the department of transportation.
      No  license  shall  be  approved  or  renewed  if  the   department   of
      transportation determines that the stoop line stand poses an obstruction
      to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians. Notwithstanding anything in

      than  four  feet  in width pursuant to section 20-237 of this subchapter
      poses an obstruction to the free use of sidewalks by pedestrians  solely
      because  the  width  of  such  stoop  line  stand exceeds four feet, the
      commissioner shall approve or renew such license  at  a  width  of  four
      feet.

Section 20-241.1 ::    
        
     
        §  20-241.1  a.  Newsstands  installed  and  maintained  pursuant to a
      franchise. a. Construction. Upon the grant of  a  franchise,  no  person
      shall  construct  or install a newsstand other than a franchisee granted
      such a franchise. Newsstands installed and maintained pursuant to such a
      franchise shall comply with all applicable law, rules and regulations.
        b. Transition. Upon the grant of a franchise, each licensee  operating
      or maintaining a newsstand licensed pursuant to this subchapter shall be
      provided  with  reasonable notice when such newsstand structure is to be
      replaced by a  newsstand  installed  and  maintained  pursuant  to  such
      franchise at a location approved by the department of transportation and
      instructions  for  applying  for  a  replacement  newsstand  within  the
      catchment area of such newsstand. Such replacement shall be  subject  to
      contractual  incentives  and/or  penalties,  if  any,  to  ensure timely
      replacement of the newsstand pursuant to such  franchise.  The  licensee
      shall  have  the  option  of  removing  the  existing  structure or such
      structure shall be removed by the  franchisee  granted  such  franchise.
      Operation  of  the  newsstand licensed pursuant to this subchapter shall
      cease during such time as the newsstand is replaced. Upon being notified
      of the completion of the replacement of the newsstand, the licensee  may
      resume  operation  pursuant  to  the terms of his or her license and the
      provisions of this subchapter.
        c. Costs. 1. The cost of constructing  and  installing  a  replacement
      newsstand by the franchisee pursuant to such franchise shall be borne by
      the   franchisee   in  accordance  with  such  franchise.  The  cost  of
      constructing and installing a newsstand by the  franchisee  pursuant  to
      such franchise, which newsstand is not a replacement newsstand, shall be
      borne by the licensee of such newsstand in accordance with paragraph two
      of this subdivision.
        2.  A  licensee  who  maintains  or operates a newsstand that is not a
      replacement newsstand and that has been constructed and installed by the
      franchisee pursuant to such franchise shall reimburse the franchisee for
      the cost of such construction and installation, which cost shall include
      costs associated with any interior electric and/or telephone hook-ups to
      the newsstand structure. The department shall determine  the  applicable
      construction  and  installation  costs  for  purposes of this paragraph,
      which costs shall be limited to the costs incurred by the franchisee and
      certified by the franchisee to the department.
        d. Fees. A licensee  licensed  to  maintain  or  operate  a  newsstand
      constructed  and  installed by the franchisee pursuant to such franchise
      shall be liable for the payment to the department of  the  biennial  fee
      for  a  license  to  operate  a  newsstand  payable  in  accordance with
      subdivision b of section 20-230 of the code.
        e. Enforcement. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law  to  the
      contrary,  the  commissioner  shall  be  authorized, after notice and an
      opportunity to be heard, to order any person who is unlawfully operating
      a newsstand that has been constructed or installed  by  a  person  other
      than  the  franchisee  in  violation of subdivision a of this section to
      remove such newsstand within seven days of the issuance of  such  order.
      Such  order  shall  be posted at the premises of such newsstand. If such
      person does not remove such newsstand within seven days of the  issuance
      of such order, an authorized officer or employee of any city agency or a
      police officer is authorized to provide for the removal of such person's
      newsstand  and  the  contents  thereof  to  a  place  of safety. If such
      newsstand or the contents thereof are not  claimed  within  thirty  days
      after  their  removal,  they  shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be
      either sold at a public auction after having been advertised in the City
      Record, the proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund,  used  or
      converted for use by the department or another city agency, or otherwise
    
      disposed  of.  Newsstands  and  the  contents  thereof  that are removed
      pursuant to this subdivision shall be released to  the  owner  or  other
      person  lawfully  entitled  to  possession upon payment of the costs for
      removal  and storage and any civil penalty imposed for the violation or,
      if an action or proceeding  for  the  violation  is  pending,  upon  the
      posting of a bond or other form of security acceptable to the department
      in an amount which will secure the payment of such costs and any penalty
      which  may  be  imposed for the violation. In the event that any removal
      made pursuant to this subdivision shall include  any  perishable  items,
      goods, or food products which cannot be retained in custody without such
      items,  goods, or food products becoming unwholesome, putrid, decomposed
      or unfit in any way, they may be delivered to the commissioner of health
      and mental hygiene for disposition pursuant to the provisions of section
      17-323 of this code.
