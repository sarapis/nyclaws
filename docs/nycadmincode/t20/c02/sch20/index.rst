Section 20-369 ::    
        
     
        § 20-369 Suspension and revocation of license. a. The commissioner may
      suspend  or  revoke a license for conduct of the licensee, its officers,
      principals,  directors,  agents  or  employees  or  in  a  closely  held
      corporation,  stockholders that would constitute grounds for denying the
      issuance of renewal of a license pursuant  to  section  20-361  of  this
      code.
        b.  The  commissioner  may suspend or revoke a cabaret or public dance
      hall license if  the  licensee  violates  the  requirements  of  section
      20-360.1  of  this  subchapter, provided, however, that the commissioner
      shall suspend or revoke a cabaret or public dance hall license upon  the
      third violation by the licensee within two years of the first violation.
        c. Upon application to the commissioner and prior to the reinstatement
      or  reissuance of a suspended or revoked license, the licensee, with the
      commissioner's approval, shall, upon payment of the fee as specified  in
      section 20-362 of this code, be permitted to operate for six months on a
      probationary  license.  At the end of such six month period, the license
      shall be reinstated or reissued unless the commissioner finds  that  the
      licensee,  its  officers, principals, directors, agents or employees or,
      in a closely held corporation, stockholders,  have  engaged  in  conduct
      that  would  constitute grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a
      license pursuant to section 20-361 of this code. Upon a finding of  such
      conduct  the  probationary  license  shall  be  revoked and shall not be
      reissued for a period of one year.

      of a license pursuant to section 20-369 of this code  upon  the  grounds
      delineated  in sections 20-361, 20-360.1 or 20-360.2 of this code, or as

      enter  into  a contract with an independent monitor approved or selected
      by the police commissioner. Such contract, the cost of  which  shall  be
      paid  by  the  licensee,  shall  provide  that  the  monitor  review the
      activities of the licensee with respect  to  the  licensee's  compliance
      with  the provisions of this subchapter, other applicable federal, state
      and local laws and such other matters as the department shall  determine

      practices it can implement to ensure compliance  with  such  provisions,
      rules  and  laws, which may include, but need not be limited to, the use
      of identification scanners at all entrances and additional training  for
      employees  concerning safety issues, conflict management and/or laws and
      liabilities associated with the illegal service of alcoholic  beverages.
      The  contract shall provide further that the monitor report the findings
      of such monitoring, including the extent to which the cabaret or  public
      dance  hall  has  complied  with  the  monitor's recommendations, to the
      department and to  the  police  commissioner  on  a  regular  basis,  as
      determined by rule of the commissioner.
