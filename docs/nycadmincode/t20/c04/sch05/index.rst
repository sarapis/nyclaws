        §  20-672  Placards to be posted. a. Except as provided in subdivision
      five of section one hundred ninety-two of the  agriculture  and  markets
      law, it shall be unlawful for any person, in connection with the sale or
      offer  for  sale  at  retail  of any petroleum products for use in motor
      vehicles or motor boats, other than gasoline or diesel  motor  fuel,  to
      post  or  maintain  at  such  place  of sale or offer to sale, any sign,
      placard or other display that states, relates or refers to the price  at
      which  such  petroleum  products are sold or offered for sale, except as
      follows:
        1. The price stated, mentioned or referred to on such sign, placard or
      other display, shall be by  the  unit  of  the  measure  at  which  such
      petroleum products are customarily sold at retail.
        2.  The  name, trade name, brand, mark or symbol, and grade or quality
      classification, if any, and  method  of  processing  of  such  petroleum
      products  shall  be  clearly  stated  on  such  signs,  placard or other
      display, and, if such petroleum products are sold without identification
      by name, trade name, brand, mark or symbol, such sign, placard or  other
      display shall refer clearly to such petroleum products as unbranded.
        b. In addition to any sign or placard required pursuant to subdivision
      five  of  section  one hundred ninety-two of the agriculture and markets
      law, there shall be a sign, poster or placard clearly visible to drivers
      of approaching motor vehicles on the premises of every location at which
      gasoline and/or diesel motor fuel are sold or  offered  for  sale.  Such
      sign  shall be in a size and style to be determined by the commissioner.
      Such sign, in addition  to  any  other  sign,  poster  or  placard  that
      advertises  the  selling  price  of  gasoline and directly or indirectly
      refers to a premises where the advertised gasoline and/or  diesel  motor
      fuel  are  sold  or  offered for sale, shall state the name, trade name,
      brand, mark or symbol  and  grade  or  quality  classification  of  such
      gasoline or diesel motor fuel, together with the total selling price per
      gallon.  Total  selling  price  shall  be the sum of the basic price per
      gallon plus all applicable taxes. Such sign,  poster  or  placard  shall
      conform  to  the rules and regulations of all governmental agencies with
      jurisdiction as to structure and location.
        1. A retail dealer shall only sell at the  total  selling  price.  Any
      such  price  when posted may not be raised for a period of not less than
      twenty-four hours.
        2. Where the total selling price for purchases made with cash is  less
      than  the total selling price for purchases made with credit card, debit
      card or other form of non-cash payment, such  sign,  poster  or  placard
      shall state the total selling price for each type of accepted payment.
        c.  All numbers referring to price shall be the same height, width and
      thickness. Identification of the gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  offered
      for  sale,  and any non-numerical language distinguishing the total cash
      selling price from the total credit card, debit card or  other  form  of
      non-cash  payment selling price shall be in letters and numbers not less
      than one-half  of  the  height,  width  and  thickness  of  the  numbers
      referring  to  price.  Letters  and  numbers  shall  be black on a white
      background.
        d. Price per gallon indicator. Except as otherwise provided in article
      sixteen of the agriculture and markets law or in any rule or regulations
      promulgated thereunder, every gasoline or diesel motor  fuel  dispensing
      device  shall  be  equipped  with a price per gallon indicator and shall
      have such indicator correspond with the total price per  gallon  on  the
      sign,  poster  or  placard required to be posted pursuant to subdivision
      five of section one hundred ninety-two of such law or subdivision  b  of
      this section.
    
        e.  Total  price  indicator.  Every  gasoline  or  diesel  motor  fuel
      dispensing device shall be equipped with a total delivery indicator, and
      such indicator shall record the correct  total  price  computed  on  the
      basis of posted price per gallon and number of gallons delivered.
        f.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  subdivisions  a, b and c of this
      section shall not apply to the posting of information  and  labeling  of
      dispensing  devices  with  respect  to  the lead content of gasoline for
      motor vehicles, which shall be governed by the provisions of subdivision
      d and e of  section  20-673.1  of  this  subchapter  and  any  rules  or
      regulations  promulgated thereunder, and subdivisions a, b and c of this

      of  this section irrespective of whether any other refiner, distributor,
      retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer may have  caused  or  permitted
      the violation; or
        (2)   the   distributor   who   sold   such   retailer   or  wholesale
      purchaser-consumer gasoline contained in the storage tank which supplied
      the pump from which the gasoline was sold, dispensed or offered for sale
      which gave rise to the violation, where the corporate,  trade  or  brand
      name  of  a refiner or any of its marketing subsidiaries does not appear
      on the pump stand and is not displayed at the retail outlet or wholesale
      purchaser-consumer facility from which the gasoline was sold,  dispensed
      or offered for sale.
        g. (1) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer
      and  any  refiner  or  distributor would be in violation or be deemed in
      violation of subdivision c of this section, the  retailer  or  wholesale
      purchaser-consumer shall not be liable if he or she can demonstrate that
      the   violation   was   not   caused   by  such  retailer  or  wholesale
      purchaser-consumer or his or her employee or agent.
        (2) In any case in which a retailer  or  wholesale  purchaser-consumer
      would  be in violation of subdivision c of this section, and a reseller,
      if any, and any refiner would be deemed in violation under paragraph one
      of subdivision f of this section, the refiner shall  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate:
        (a)  that  the  violation was not caused by such refiner or his or her
      employee or agent, and
        (b) that the violation was caused by an act in violation of  any  law,
      other  than  the  provisions  of  this  section,  or an act of sabotage,
      vandalism, or deliberate commingling of leaded  and  unleaded  gasoline,
      whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where
      the violation of the requirements of this section occurred, or
        (c)  that  the  violation  was caused by the action of a reseller or a
      retailer supplied by  such  reseller,  in  violation  of  a  contractual
      undertaking  imposed by the refiner on such reseller designed to prevent
      such action, and despite reasonable efforts by  the  refiner  to  insure
      compliance  with such contractual obligation, such as periodic sampling,
      or
        (d) that the violation was caused by the action of a retailer  who  is
      supplied  directly by the refiner and not by a reseller, in violation of
      a contractual undertaking  imposed  by  the  refiner  on  such  retailer
      designed  to  prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the
      refiner to insure compliance with such contractual obligation,  such  as
      periodic sampling, or
    
        (e)  that  the  violation  was  caused  by the action of a distributor
      subject to a contract with the refiner for  transportation  of  gasoline
      from    a   terminal   to   a   distributor,   retailer   or   wholesale
      purchaser-consumer, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by
      the  refiner  on  such  distributor designed to prevent such action, and
      despite reasonable efforts by the refiner to insure compliance with such
      contractual obligation, such as periodic sampling, or
        (f) that the violation was caused by a distributor (such as  a  common
      carrier)  not  subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by him
      or her for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a  distributor,
      retailer  or wholesale purchaser-consumer, despite reasonable efforts by
      the refiner to prevent such action, such as specification or  inspection
      of equipment, or
        (g)  that  the  violation  occurred  at a wholesale purchaser-consumer
      facility; provided, however, that if such  wholesale  purchaser-consumer
      was  supplied  by  a  reseller,  the  refiner  must demonstrate that the
      violation could not have been prevented by  such  reseller's  compliance
      with  a  contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller
      as provided in subparagraph c of this paragraph.
        (h) For purposes of subparagraphs (b) through (f) of  this  paragraph,
      the  term  "was  caused"  means  that  the  refiner  must demonstrate by
      reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial  evidence  that
      the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
        (3)  In  any  case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer
      would be in violation of subdivision c of this section, and  a  reseller
      and  any  refiner  would  be  deemed in violation under paragraph one of
      subdivision f of this section, the  reseller  shall  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate that the violation was not caused
      by such reseller or his or her employee or agent.
        (4)  In  any  case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer
      would be in  violation  of  subdivision  c  of  this  section,  and  any
      distributor  would  be  deemed  in  violation  under  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision f of this section, the distributor will  not  be  deemed  in
      violation if he or she can demonstrate that the violation was not caused
      by such distributor or his or her employee or agent.

      preceding  twenty-four  month period shall be liable for a civil penalty

        c. (1) If, after providing due notice and an opportunity to be  heard,
      the  commissioner finds that a person has violated any of the provisions
      of section 20-673.2  of  this  subchapter  or  any  rule  or  regulation
      promulgated thereunder, he or she shall be authorized to issue and serve
      upon such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from
      engaging  in  the prohibited activity. Such order shall become final (i)
      upon the expiration of the time allowed for  filing  any  administrative
      appeal  which  may be available and for commencing a proceeding pursuant
      to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules  or  (ii)
      upon  the  exhaustion  of  all  appeals  arising  out of the proceedings

      dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for each violation.
        (2) Any person who violates the provisions of section 20-673.2 of this
      subchapter  or  any  rules  or  regulations  promulgated thereunder with
      actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis  of  objective
      circumstances  that  the  act  or  practice  underlying the violation is
      unfair or deceptive shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than
      five hundred dollars nor  more  than  ten  thousand  dollars;  provided,
      however,  that  in  order  for any retailer to be held liable under this
      paragraph for violating any of the provisions of subdivisions d or e  of
      such  section  20-673.2, such retailer shall be shown to have had actual
    
      knowledge that the act or practice underlying the violation is unfair or
      deceptive. In determining the amount of any civil penalty imposed  under
      this  paragraph,  the  following  shall  be  considered:  the  degree of
      culpability;  any  history of prior such conduct; ability to pay; effect
      on ability to continue to do business; and such other matters as justice
      may require.
        d. In the case of a violation through  continuing  failure  to  comply
      with  any of the provisions of this subchapter, any rules or regulations
      promulgated thereunder, or any order of the commissioner issued pursuant

      failure shall be treated as a separate violation.
        e.  The  civil  penalties prescribed by the provisions of this section
      may be imposed by the commissioner after due notice and  an  opportunity
      to  be heard have been provided or may be recovered in a civil action in
      the name of the city, commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In
      any civil action commenced to recover civil penalties for violation of a
      final order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision c of this
      section, the supreme court of  New  York  is  empowered  to  grant  such
      injunctive  or  equitable  relief  as the court deems appropriate in the
      enforcement of such final order.
        f. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner shall cause  to  be
      published  in  the  City  Record  once  each month the name and business
      location of any person, firm or corporation that has been found to  have
      violated any provision of sections 20-673.1 or 20-673.2 during the month
      immediately preceding.
