Section 20-101 ::    
        
     
        § 20-101 Legislative intent. The council finds that for the protection
      and  relief  of  the  public  from  deceptive, unfair and unconscionable
      practices, for the maintenance of standards of  integrity,  honesty  and
      fair  dealing  among  persons  and  organizations  engaging  in licensed
      activities, for the protection of the health and safety of the people of
      New York city and for other purposes requisite to promoting the  general
      welfare,  licensing by the department of consumer affairs is a necessary
      and proper mode of regulation with respect to certain trades, businesses
      and industries. The council finds further that, in order to  secure  the
      above-mentioned  purposes,  and  generally to carry out responsibilities
      for supervising and regulating licensed activities,  trades,  businesses
      and  industries,  the  commissioner of consumer affairs requires powers,
      remedies and sanctions which  are  equitable,  flexible  and  efficient.
      Finally,  the  council finds that sanctions and penalties applied by the
      commissioner and by the courts for the violation of laws and regulations
      by  individuals  and  organizations   engaging   in   various   licensed
      activities,  trades,  businesses  and  industries, must be sufficient to
      achieve these above-mentioned purposes of licensing.

      in-pricing-law); provided that such violation is committed in the course
    
      of  and  is  related to the conduct of the business, trade or occupation

      hearing at the department after due notice of such hearing. If a license
      has been suspended, it shall be returned  to  the  department  forthwith
      upon  receipt  of  the  order  of  suspension.  Failure to surrender the
      license shall be grounds for a fine or civil penalty  or  revocation  of
      the license.
        (5)  Any  of  the  remedies  provided  for in this section shall be in
      addition to any other remedies provided under  any  other  provision  of
      law.
        f.  The  commissioner,  upon  due notice and hearing, may require that
      persons licensed under chapter two of  this  title  who  have  committed
      repeated,  multiple or persistent violations of chapter two or any other
      law,  rule  or  regulation  the  enforcement  of  which  is  within  the
      jurisdiction  of the department, conspicuously display at their place of
      business and in advertisements a notice (of a form, content and size  to

      record of such violations; provided that, for each time such display  is

      that  are  committed  with  the  use  of  the  applicant's or licensee's

      grounds to believe the proscribed acts were taking place with the use of
      the licensee's equipment, data, technology, or other similar resource or
      that  the  proscribed  acts  were  not  taking place with the use of the
      applicant's or licensee's equipment, data, technology, or other  similar
      resource.

Section 20-107 ::    
        
     
        * § 20-107 Applications; filing fee; license fee. All applications for
      licenses  shall  be  made  to  the  commissioner  or  the commissioner's
      designee in such form and detail  as  shall  be  prescribed.  Except  as
      specifically  provided  in  chapter two, every application shall include
      the license fee for the full license term. If the license is not issued,
      the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of  the  amount  of  the  annual
      license  fee  shall  be  retained  by the department as a non-returnable
      filing fee. In the event a license is issued  for  less  than  the  full
      license  term,  the applicable fee shall be decreased proportionately to
      the nearest half year, except that in no case shall the fee be less than
      the fee for one-half year. Where a two year license is surrendered for a
      reason other than suspension or revocation and less than one year of the
      license term has expired, the licensee may apply  for  a  refund  of  an
      amount equal to one year's license fee. Except as otherwise specifically
      provided  for  in  chapter  two,  reference to fees, license fees or any
      other word of similar import shall be deemed to be the license  fee  for
      one  year.  Notwithstanding  any inconsistent provision of this section,
      whenever the commissioner increases or decreases the term of a  type  of
      license  pursuant  to  section  20-108 of this chapter, the fee for such
      license shall be increased or decreased proportionately and  the  amount
      of  refund  due  upon surrender of such license before the expiration of
      the term for a reason other  than  suspension  or  revocation  shall  be
      prorated to the unexpired term.
        * NB Effective until April 16, 2014
        * §  20-107 Applications; filing fee; license fee. a. All applications
      for licenses shall be made to the  commissioner  or  the  commissioner's
      designee in such form and detail as shall be prescribed.
        b.  Every  application  for  a  license  or the renewal of an existing
      license shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to  indicate  the
      language  in which he or she would prefer that inspections in connection
      with such license be conducted. Nothing  in  this  subdivision  nor  any
      failure  to  comply  with  such  preference  shall be construed so as to
      create a  cause  of  action  or  constitute  a  defense  in  any  legal,
      administrative, or other proceeding.
        c.  Except  as specifically provided in chapter two, every application
      shall include the license fee for the full license term. If the  license
      is  not issued, the lesser of fifty dollars or one-half of the amount of
      the annual license  fee  shall  be  retained  by  the  department  as  a
      non-returnable  filing  fee.  In  the event a license is issued for less
      than the full license  term,  the  applicable  fee  shall  be  decreased
      proportionately  to  the nearest half year, except that in no case shall
      the fee be less than the fee for one-half year. Where a two year license
      is surrendered for a reason other than suspension or revocation and less
      than one year of the license term has expired, the  licensee  may  apply
      for  a  refund  of  an amount equal to one year's license fee. Except as
      otherwise specifically provided for in chapter two, reference  to  fees,
      license  fees  or any other word of similar import shall be deemed to be
      the license fee for one year. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision
      of this section, whenever the commissioner increases  or  decreases  the
      term  of  a  type of license pursuant to section 20-108 of this chapter,
      the fee for such license shall be increased or decreased proportionately
      and the amount of refund due upon surrender of such license  before  the
      expiration  of the term for a reason other than suspension or revocation
      shall be prorated to the unexpired term.

      term  unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  for  in  chapter   two;

Section 20-117. ::    
        
     
        §   20-117.  Licensee  disclosure  of  security  breach;  notification
      requirements.
        a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section,
        1. The term "personal identifying information" shall mean any person's
      date  of  birth,  social  security  number,  driver's  license   number,
      non-driver  photo identification card number, financial services account
      number or code, savings account number or code, checking account  number
      or code, brokerage account number or code, credit card account number or
      code,  debit  card  number  or  code, automated teller machine number or
      code, personal identification number,  mother's  maiden  name,  computer
      system password, electronic signature or unique biometric data that is a
      fingerprint, voice print, retinal image or iris image of another person.
      This  term  shall  apply to all such data, notwithstanding the method by
      which such information is maintained.
        2. The term "breach of security" shall mean unauthorized possession of
      personal  identifying  information  that   compromises   the   security,
      confidentiality   or  integrity  of  such  information.  Good  faith  or
      inadvertent possession of any personal  identifying  information  by  an
      employee  or  agent  of  the licensee for the legitimate purposes of the
      business of the licensee shall not constitute a breach of security.
        b. Any person required to be licensed pursuant to chapter two of  this
      title,   or  pursuant  to  provisions  of  state  law  enforced  by  the
      department, that owns or leases data that includes personal  identifying
      information  and  any person required to be licensed pursuant to chapter
      two of this title, or pursuant to provisions of state  law  enforced  by
      the  department,  that  maintains  but  does  not own data that includes
      personal identifying  information  shall  immediately  disclose  to  the
      department and to the police department any breach of security following
      discovery  by  a  supervisor  or manager, or following notification to a
      supervisor or manager, of  such  breach  if  such  personal  identifying
      information   is  reasonably  believed  to  have  been  acquired  by  an
      unauthorized person.
        c.  Subsequent  to  compliance  with  the  provisions  set  forth   in
      subdivision  b  of  this  section,  any  person  required to be licensed
      pursuant to chapter two of this title,  or  pursuant  to  provisions  of
      state  law  enforced  by  the  department, that owns or leases data that
      includes personal identifying information shall disclose, in  accordance
      with  the  procedures  set  forth  in subdivision e of this section, any
      breach of security following discovery by a supervisor  or  manager,  or
      following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such breach to any
      person  whose  personal  identifying  information  was, or is reasonably
      believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.
        d.  Subsequent  to  compliance  with  the  provisions  set  forth   in
      subdivision  b  of  this  section,  any  person  required to be licensed
      pursuant to chapter two of this title,  or  pursuant  to  provisions  of
      state  law  enforced  by the department, that maintains but does not own
      data that includes personal identifying information shall  disclose,  in
      accordance  with  the  procedures  set  forth  in  subdivision e of this
      section, any breach of security following discovery by a  supervisor  or
      manager,  or  following notification to a supervisor or manager, of such
      breach to the owner, lessor or licensor of  the  data  if  the  personal
      identifying  information  was,  or  is reasonably believed to have been,
      acquired by an unauthorized person.
        e. The disclosures required by subdivisions c and d  of  this  section
      shall  be  made  as soon as practicable by a method reasonable under the
      circumstances.  Provided  said  method  is  not  inconsistent  with  the
      legitimate  needs  of  law  enforcement  or  any  other investigative or
      protective measures necessary to restore the reasonable integrity of the
    
      data system, disclosure shall be made by at least one of  the  following
      means:
        1.  Written notice to the individual at his or her last known address;
      or
        2. Verbal notification to the individual by telephonic  communication;
      or
        3.  Electronic notification to the individual at his or her last known
      e-mail address.
        f. Should disclosure pursuant to  paragraphs  one,  two  or  three  of
      subdivision  e be impracticable or inappropriate given the circumstances
      of the breach and the identity of the victim, such disclosure  shall  be
      made  by a mechanism of the licensee's choosing, provided such mechanism
      is reasonably targeted to the individual  in  a  manner  that  does  not
      further  compromise  the integrity of the personal information disclosed
      and has been approved, or is in compliance with  rules  promulgated,  by
      the Commissioner.
        g.  Any person required to be licensed pursuant to chapter two of this
      title,  or  pursuant  to  provisions  of  state  law  enforced  by   the
      department,  that  discards  any  records  of  an  individual's personal
      identifying information shall do so in  a  manner  intended  to  prevent
      retrieval of the information contained therein or thereon.
        h.  Any person required to be licensed pursuant to chapter two of this
      title,  or  pursuant  to  provisions  of  state  law  enforced  by   the
      department,  who  shall  violate  any of the provisions of this section,
      upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of not more  than
      five  hundred  dollars ($500) and shall be liable for a civil penalty of
      one hundred dollars ($100) for each violation.
