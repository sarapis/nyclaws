        b.  The  failure  to  comply  with a notice or order of the department
      issued  pursuant  to  this  code  within  the  time  provided  for  such
      compliance  in  the  order  shall  be  dealt with in accordance with the
      provisions of this code. Nothing contained herein shall, however,  limit
      or  render  inapplicable  other  provisions  of  the administrative code
      relating to the enforcement of orders of the department or  commissioner
      of the department under other applicable provisions of law.
        c.  The  department  shall have the power to issue an order to correct
      any underlying condition existing in a building that has  caused  or  is
      causing  a  violation  of this code, of the multiple dwelling law, or of
      other state and local laws that impose requirements on dwellings.
        1. Such order may be issued to an owner of a building that  meets  the
      criteria promulgated by the department in rules.
        2.  The  department  may  file  such order in the office of the county
      clerk in the county in which the building is located. Where  such  order
      has  been  filed  by  the department and complied with by the owner, the
      department shall file a rescission of the order with such county clerk.
        3. An owner shall comply with such order and submit such documentation
      as the department may require indicating compliance with  the  order  no
      later  than  four  months  after  the  order  has been issued, provided,
      however, that the department may extend the deadline for compliance by a
      period not to exceed two months, in accordance with criteria promulgated
      by the department in rules. If such owner  fails  to  comply  with  such
      order,  the  department  may perform all or part of the work required by
      such order.
        4. All amounts for expenses incurred by  the  department  pursuant  to
      this subdivision that remain unpaid by an owner, shall constitute a debt
      recoverable  from  the  owner  and a lien upon the building and lot, and
      upon the rents and other income thereof. The provisions of article eight
      of subchapter five of this code shall govern the effect and  enforcement
      of  such  debt and lien. The department may serve a statement of account
      upon an owner for such amounts pursuant to section 27-2129 of this code.
        5. Notwithstanding any provision of this  code  to  the  contrary,  an
      owner  who  fails  to  comply  with  an  order  issued  pursuant to this
      subdivision shall be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand  dollars
      for  each  dwelling  unit  that  is the subject of such order, provided,
      however, that the total amount of such penalty shall not  be  less  than
      five thousand dollars.

      of  the  acts  or omissions described in paragraphs, one, two, three and
      four of subdivision a of this section which are committed  at  a  single
      room occupancy multiple dwelling shall be presumed to be committed by or
      on  behalf  of  the  owner  of  such  multiple  dwelling and it shall be
      presumed that such acts or omissions were committed with the  intent  to
      cause a person lawfully entitled to occupancy of a dwelling unit in such
      multiple  dwelling  to vacate such unit or to surrender or waive a right
      in relation to such occupancy.
        c. The commissioner shall certify whether there has been no harassment

      such term is defined in section 27-198 of article nineteen of subchapter
      one of the building code, during the thirty-six month  period  prior  to
      the  date  of the submission of an application for a certification of no
      harassment by an owner of such multiple dwelling.  With  respect  to  an
      application  for  a  certification  of  no harassment which is submitted
      pursuant to paragraph three  of  subdivision  b  of  section  27-198  of
      article  nineteen  of  subchapter  one of the building code, the date of
      submission of such application  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      submission of an application for plan approval.
        d.  An application for certification of no harassment shall be in such
      form and shall contain such  information  and  provisions  as  shall  be
      prescribed by the commissioner including, but not limited to, consent by
      the  applicant  to  access to the premises by governmental agencies, and
      shall be determined in accordance with the following procedure:
        (1) Upon the receipt of an  application  for  a  certification  of  no
      harassment, the commissioner shall publish notice in such publication as
      the  commissioner  deems  appropriate  for a period of seven consecutive
    
      days, shall mail notice to the owner of record, such  occupants  as  the
      department   shall  identify,  such  other  interested  persons  as  the
      department shall identify, the local  community  board  and  appropriate
      government  agencies and shall post notice in a conspicuous place on the
      premises of the multiple dwelling for which the certification is sought.
        (2) The notice shall be in such form as shall  be  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner and shall state, in English and whatever other language the
      commissioner deems appropriate:
        (a)  the location and general description of the multiple dwelling for
      which the certification is sought;
        (b) a description of the certification procedure and its purpose;
        (c) the period of time for which certification is to be made;
        (d)  in  plain  language,  a  description  of   conduct   constituting
      harassment; and
        (e)  that  any  occupants or former occupants of the multiple dwelling
      for which such certification is sought  and  other  interested  persons,
      government agencies and the local community board, are invited to submit
      their  comments within thirty days of the date of such notice in writing
      or orally at a designated location.
        (3) Upon the  expiration  of  such  thirty  day  comment  period,  the
      commissioner  may  (i)  determine that no harassment has occurred within
      the stated period of time and forthwith grant such  certification,  (ii)
      determine  that  a  waiver  of  certification may be granted pursuant to
      subdivision e of this section and forthwith grant such waiver, or  (iii)
      deny  such  certification  without  a  prior hearing if there has been a
      finding by the office of rent  control,  the  conciliation  and  appeals
      board  or  any court having jurisdiction that there has been harassment,
      unlawful eviction or arson by or on behalf of the owner at the  multiple
      dwelling  for  which certification is sought during the stated period of
      time; or (iv) where there has been no prior determination of harassment,
      unlawful eviction or arson by or on behalf of the owner, provide that  a
      hearing  be  held  in  the  manner  provided  in section 27-2092 of this
      article if  the  commissioner  has  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that
      harassment  has  occurred  within  such stated period of time and that a
      waiver of certification may not be granted. At such hearing,  the  owner
      of  the  multiple dwelling for which such certification is sought, shall
      have the opportunity to be heard by the commissioner or a designee prior
      to the granting or denial of  certification  or  of  a  waiver  thereof.
      Notice  of  such  hearing  shall  be given to the applicant and to other
      interested parties, governmental agencies and local community  board  in
      the   manner   to   be  prescribed  by  rules  and  regulations  of  the
      commissioner.  Within  forty-five   days   after   such   hearing,   the
      commissioner  shall  either  grant  or deny such certification or waiver
      thereof.
        (4) If certification or a waiver thereof is  denied,  notice  of  such
      denial  accompanied  by written findings indicating the grounds for such
      denial shall be mailed to the owner of record and shall be filed in  the
      office  of  the  city  register.  Such determination shall be subject to
      review pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and
      rules.
        (5)  Neither  such certification nor a waiver thereof shall be granted
      unless the applicant submits a sworn statement,  in  such  form  as  the
      commissioner shall prescribe, by all the owners of the multiple dwelling
      representing  that  there will be no harassment of the occupants of such
      multiple dwelling by or  on  behalf  of  such  owners.  The  corporation
      counsel may institute any action or proceeding in any court of competent
      jurisdiction that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of
      this  representation  and  agreement.  Nothing  contained  herein  shall
    
      preclude an occupant of such multiple dwelling from applying on  his  or
      her own behalf for similar relief.
        *  (6)  The  commissioner  shall  promulgate  rules and regulations to
      establish procedures relating to applications for and  the  issuance  of
      supplemental certifications as required by paragraph nine of subdivision
      b of section 27-198 of the code.
     
          * NB Added L.L. 59/85 § 4, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
     
        e.  The  commissioner  may  grant  a  waiver  of  certification  of no
      harassment although the  commissioner  determines  that  harassment  has
      occurred at the multiple dwelling for which such certification is sought
      during  the  thirty-six month period prior to the date of the submission
      of  an  application  for  a  certification  of  no  harassment  if   the
      commissioner finds that:
        (1)  (a)  the owner of record of the multiple dwelling with respect to
      which such certification is sought was  the  owner  of  record  of  such
      multiple  dwelling  prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three or
      had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase  of  such  multiple
      dwelling  which  was  recorded  prior to such date or, with respect to a
      certification proceeding where the alterations sought  to  be  performed
      are of the type prescribed by regulation of the commissioner pursuant to
      subdivision b of section 27-198 of article nineteen of subchapter one of
      the building code, the owner of record of such multiple dwelling was the
      owner of record of such multiple dwelling prior to the date of the first
      publication  of the regulations requiring certification for such type of
      alterations or had entered into a contract of sale for the  purchase  of
      such multiple dwelling which was recorded prior to such date;
        (b)  such owner was not the owner of such multiple dwelling during any
      period of time in which such harassment occurred and  did  not  at  such
      multiple   dwelling   (i)   otherwise  engage  or  participate  in  such
      harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with
      one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment;
      or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct  constituting
      harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to
      cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment; and
        (c) such owner acquired title pursuant to a bona fide transaction that
      is not intended to evade the provisions of this section; or
        (2)  the  owner  acquired  the  multiple  dwelling by sale pursuant to
      foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant to a deed in lieu  of  foreclosure
      of  a  mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide
      transaction for the purpose of enforcing the debt and  not  intended  to
      evade the provisions of this section and either
        (i)  a  certification  of  no harassment or waiver thereof was granted
      with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day  period  prior
      to  the  date  of  the  recording  of such mortgage and no suspension or
      rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or
        (ii) such mortgage was recorded prior to May fifth,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-three,  or, if such owner is a banking organization as defined in
      section two of the  banking  law,  a  national  banking  association,  a
      federal   savings   and   loan   association,  the  mortgage  facilities
      corporation, savings  banks  life  insurance  fund,  the  savings  banks
      retirement  system,  an authorized insurer as defined in section four of
      the insurance law, or a trust company  or  other  corporation  organized
      under  the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by
      at least twenty savings banks or by at least  twenty  savings  and  loan
      associations  or  a  subsidiary  corporation all of the capital stock of
      which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, a  commitment
    
      for  such  mortgage  was  made  prior  to  May  fifth,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-three.
        (3)  In  determining  whether  such  transaction  was  bona  fide, the
      commissioner may consider whether at such multiple dwelling or any other
      such  multiple  dwelling  such  owner  did  (i)  otherwise   engage   or
      participate  in  harassment;  or  (ii)  with  intent  that harassment be
      performed, agree with one or more persons to  engage  in  or  cause  the
      performance  of  harassment;  or  (iii)  with intent that another person
      engage in conduct constituting harassment,  solicit,  request,  command,
      importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct
      constituting   harassment.   The  commissioner  may  also  consider  the
      relationship between the parties to the transaction.
        (4) A waiver of a certification pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall
      state the findings of the commissioner.
        f.  (1)  The commissioner may rescind a certification of no harassment
      or a waiver thereof granted with respect to the alteration or demolition
      of a multiple dwelling if the commissioner  finds  that  harassment  has
      occurred   at   the   multiple  dwelling  with  respect  to  which  such
      certification or waiver thereof was issued  after  the  period  of  time
      covered   by  such  certification  but  prior  to  the  commencement  of
      substantial work pursuant to an alteration permit or  demolition  permit
      issued on the basis of such certification or waiver thereof.
        (2)  If  the  commissioner  has  reasonable cause to believe that such
      harassment  has   occurred,   the   commissioner   shall   suspend   the
      certification of no harassment or waiver thereof and upon the request of
      the  commissioner,  the  commissioner of buildings shall not approve any
      plans or issue an alteration or demolition permit with  respect  to  the
      alteration  or  demolition  of  such multiple dwelling or, if such plans
      have been approved and an  alteration  or  demolition  permit  has  been
      issued  with respect to such alteration or demolition, issue a stop-work
      notice and order pursuant to section 27-227 of  article  twenty-four  of
      subchapter  one of the building code. Notice of such suspension shall be
      mailed to the owner of record of such multiple  dwelling  and  shall  be
      filed with the city register.
        (3)  As  soon  as  reasonably possible, but not later than thirty days
      after such suspension, the commissioner shall  hold  a  hearing  in  the
      manner  provided  in  section  27-2092  of this article upon appropriate
      notice and  shall  determine  whether  to  rescind  such  certification;
      provided,  however,  that  if,  prior to the commencement of substantial
      work, the owner has been found  by  the  office  of  rent  control,  the
      conciliation and appeals board or any court having jurisdiction, to have
      engaged  in  harassment,  unlawful  eviction  or  arson  at the multiple
      dwelling,  the  commissioner  may  rescind  such  certification  without
      holding  a hearing.  At such hearing the owner shall have an opportunity
      to be heard by the commissioner or a designee of the commissioner.
        (4) If the commissioner determines not to rescind such  certification,
      the  commissioner  shall  notify  the  commissioner of buildings of such
      determination  and  any  stop-work  notice  and  order  issued  by   the
      commissioner  of buildings pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision
      shall be vacated immediately. Notice  of  such  determination  shall  be
      mailed  to  the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and filed with
      the city register.
        (5) If the commissioner determines that such  certification  shall  be
      rescinded,  notice of such determination accompanied by written findings
      indicating the grounds for such determination shall be provided  to  the
      commissioner  of buildings and shall be mailed to the owner of record of
      such  multiple  dwelling  and  filed  with  the  city   register.   Such
    
      determination   shall   be   subject   to  review  pursuant  to  article
      seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules.
        (g)  For  the  purpose of any subsequent certification proceeding with
      respect to such multiple dwelling pursuant to this section, the granting
      of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for  any  period
      of  time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section
      that either no harassment occurred within the  time  period  covered  by
      such  certification  or  that  the waiver of such certification for such
      period of time was appropriate.
        h. The commissioner is authorized to establish and collect  reasonable
      fees  and  charges  from  applicants  for  the  administrative  expenses
      incurred by the department for the certification proceedings  prescribed
      in this section, including costs for publication and notices.

      subchapter,  by  mailing  a  copy  thereof  to  the  latest  business or
      residence  address  of  such  managing  agent  set  forth  in  any  such
      registration  statement  or  designation  filed  by  the  owner  of such
      dwelling;
        (iii) If service is to be made on an owner of a dwelling who  has  not
      filed  such a registration statement in relation to such dwelling, or on
      a managing agent of any such dwelling who has not been designated  under
      the  applicable provisions of article two of this subchapter, by posting
      a copy of such notice or order in a conspicuous place in such  dwelling,
      or  by  delivering  a  copy  thereof  to  any person of suitable age and
      discretion in charge of or apparently in charge of such dwelling, or  by
      mailing a copy thereof to such owner or managing agent at the last known
      business or residence address of such owner or managing agent.
        b. Any such notice directed to an owner of a dwelling or tenant of any
      space therein need not designate such owner or tenant by name, but shall
      refer  to  such  dwelling  or  space  by  a  description  which shall be
      sufficient to identify same and shall state that it is directed  to  the
      owner of such dwelling or tenant of such space, as the case may be.
        c.  Where  a  designation  of  a  managing  agent under the applicable
      provisions of article two of this subchapter is currently in  effect  as
      to  any multiple dwelling, any notice mentioned in subdivision a of this
      section which is directed to the owner of such multiple  dwelling  shall
      also  be  directed  to  such  managing agent, and shall be served by the
      department on both such owner and managing agent.
        d. If a  mortgagee  or  lienor  has  registered  with  the  department
      pursuant  to  the  provisions  of section 27-2109 of article two of this
      subchapter, any notice of  violation  or  other  notice,  or  any  order
      authorized  or  required  to  be  served  by  the  department  under the
      provisions of this code on the owner of a dwelling may also be mailed to
      such mortgagee or lienor no later than five days  after  the  date  upon
      which   such  notice  or  order  is  served  upon  the  owner,  but  the
      department's failure to mail such notice or order to such  mortgagee  or
      lienor  shall  not  in  any  way  affect the validity of service of such
      notice or order upon the owner.
