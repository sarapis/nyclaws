        §  27-2041  Peepholes.  In  every dwelling the owner shall provide and
      maintain a peephole in the entrance door of  each  dwelling  unit.  Such
      peephole  shall  be  located, as prescribed by the department, in such a
      place that the person in each dwelling unit may view from the inside any
      person immediately outside the entrance  door.  However,  such  peephole
      need  not  be  installed  in any tenant-occupied one- or two-family home
      where it is possible to see  from  the  inside  any  person  immediately
      outside  the  entrance  door.  This  section  shall not apply to hotels,
      apartment hotels,  college  or  school  dormitories,  or  owner-occupied
      dwelling units in one- and two-family homes.
