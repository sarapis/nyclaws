Article 14 - LEAD POISONING PREVENTION AND CONTROL
==================================================

Section 27-2056.1
-----------------

Section 27-2056.1 ::    
        
     
        § 27-2056.1 Statement of findings and purposes. The council finds that
      lead  poisoning  from  paint  containing lead is a preventable childhood
      disease and a public health crisis. The council further finds  that  the
      hazard in dwellings that may occur from paint containing lead is subject
      to  many factors, such as the age of a building and its maintenance. The
      Council also finds and declares  that  City  government  must  focus  on
      primary  prevention  as  the  essential  tool  to  combat childhood lead
      poisoning and to achieve the goal of preventing children from  suffering
      the  adverse  health  and other effects of exposure to lead-based paint.
      The pursuit of primary prevention, which means eliminating lead  hazards
      before  children  are exposed, has been recommended by the United States
      Centers for Disease Control  and  Prevention  and  promoted  by  leading
      experts  in  the  field  as  a  critical course of action to protect the
      health  of  young  children.  The  Council,  therefore,  declares   that
      resources  must be directed to primary prevention, including identifying
      children who are most at risk.
        The council recognizes that it cannot legislate a  single  maintenance
      standard  for  all  dwellings  to  eliminate  this  hazard. Instead, the
      council by enacting this article makes it the  responsibility  of  every
      owner   of  a  multiple  dwelling  to  investigate  dwelling  units  for
      lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on  a  case-by-case
      basis  as  the  conditions  may  warrant,  taking  such  actions  as are
      necessary to  prevent  a  child  from  becoming  lead  poisoned.  Having
      established  this  responsibility,  the  council  finds  that sufficient
      information exists to guide owners in making  determinations  about  the
      existence   of  lead-based  paint  hazards.  See,  e.g.,  United  States
      environmental protection agency, "Identification of Dangerous Levels  of
      Lead;  Final  Rule"  Federal Register, Vol. 66, No. 4 (January 5, 2001);
      United States department of housing and urban  development,  "Guidelines
      for  the  Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing"
      (June 1995, revised 1997).
        The New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported
      for  the  year  2001  that  among  children  tested,  5,638  were  newly
      identified  with  elevated  blood  lead  levels  of  10  micrograms  per
      deciliter or above. The New York city department of  health  and  mental
      hygiene  has  reported for the year 2001 that among children tested, 653
      were  newly  identified  at  or  above  the  department's  environmental
      intervention  blood  lead level, which is a blood lead level equal to or
      exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter in a single test or  two  reported
      blood  lead  levels  between 15 and 19 micrograms per deciliter at least
      three months apart, and has also reported an overall  incidence  of  931
      children  tested  with  blood  lead  levels  equal  to  or  exceeding 20
      micrograms per deciliter. When a child is identified with  environmental
      intervention  blood  lead  levels,  the city is obligated to investigate
      potential sources of the lead poisoning, incurring  the  expense  of  an
      environmental  investigation  and often times also incurring the expense
      of medical treatment and remedial education, if necessary.  The  council
      finds  that  these  blood  lead  levels  among  New  York  city children
      constitute a severe health crisis and has established as  its  goal  the
      elimination of childhood lead poisoning by the year 2010.
        In  addition, the department of health and mental hygiene has reported
      for the year 2001 that only 29% of children in New York city are  tested
      both  at  age  one  and  age  two for the disease of lead poisoning even
      though the testing of all children at age one and age two  is  mandatory
      under  state  law. The council finds that improved screening among these
      children is critical since children at these ages are at  greatest  risk
      for  lead  poisoning.  The  council  declares  that it is reasonable and
      necessary to increase the rate of blood-lead  testing.  This  local  law
    
      requires  the  department  of health and mental hygiene to report to the
      council on progress toward increasing screening rates and  reducing  the
      incidence  rates  of  children newly identified with elevated blood lead
      levels.
        The  council  further finds that the administration and enforcement of
      the City's lead poisoning prevention programs can be better coordinated.
      While it is intended that the department  of  housing  preservation  and
      development  remain  the  agency  responsible for the implementation and
      enforcement of this article, it is also intended that the department  of
      health  and  mental  hygiene  shall  have  a  significant  role  in  the
      promulgation and interpretation of  rules  and  in  the  development  of
      necessary procedures pursuant to this article.

      to:
        (i) the correction of a violation of this article of the code, and
        (ii)  compliance with the rules promulgated by the department pursuant
      to section 27-2056.11 of this code; and
    
        (6) procedures to be established  by  the  department  of  health  and
      mental  hygiene  to  order  or  provide  for the expeditious cleanup and
      removal of lead-contaminated dust when  the  department  of  health  and
      mental  hygiene  determines  that  there  is lead-contaminated dust in a
      dwelling unit where a child of applicable age resides, such child has an
      elevated  blood  level,  and the department of health and mental hygiene
      determines that the source of  that  lead-contaminated  dust  is  not  a
      condition of the dwelling in which such dwelling unit is located.

Section 27-2056.11 ::    
        
     
        § 27-2056.11 Work Practices. a. The department shall promulgate rules,
      with  the  approval  of  the  department  of  health and mental hygiene,
      establishing work practices to which an owner shall be subject  in  each
      of the following circumstances:
        (1) where an owner is performing work in order to comply with a notice
      of  violation  or  order to correct issued by the department pursuant to
      this article, which shall be no less stringent than the safety standards
      required by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene whenever  such
      commissioner  shall  order  the  abatement  of  lead-based paint hazards
      pursuant to section 173.13 of the health code or a successor rule.  Such
      rules  shall  provide  for temporary relocation provided by the owner of
      the occupants of a dwelling or dwelling unit to appropriate housing when
      work cannot be performed safely. Such rules shall provide that all  such
      work  be  performed  only  by firms which have received certification to
      perform lead abatement under the regulations issued by the United States
      environmental protection agency at subpart L of part 745 of title 40  of
      the code of federal regulations, or any successor regulations.
        (2)  where  an owner, other than in response to an order to correct or
      notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health
      and mental hygiene, is performing  work  that  will  disturb  lead-based
      paint  or paint of unknown lead content in a dwelling unit where a child
      of applicable age resides or in the common area of the multiple dwelling
      in which such dwelling unit is located, where such multiple dwelling was
      erected prior to January first, nineteen hundred  sixty,  or  where  the
      owner  has actual knowledge of the presence of lead-based paint and such
      multiple dwelling was  erected  on  or  after  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred sixty and before January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight.
        (i)  Except  as  provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, such
      rules shall incorporate work practices that are no  less  protective  of
      public  health  than  those set forth in subdivisions d and e of section
      173.14 of the health code and those  parts  of  subdivision  b  of  such
      section  applicable  thereto  or  a  successor rule, and shall include a
      requirement that lead-contaminated dust clearance testing  be  performed
      at  the completion of such work. Such rules shall require that such work
      be performed by a person who has, at a minimum, successfully completed a
      course on lead-safe  work  practices  given  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
      department  or,  by the United States environmental protection agency or
      an entity authorized by it to give such course, or by the United  States
      department  of  housing and urban development or an entity authorized by
      it to give such course. Such rules shall  require  temporary  relocation
      provided by the owner of the occupants of a dwelling or dwelling unit to
      appropriate housing when work cannot be performed safely.
        (ii) Where such work will disturb more than one hundred square feet of
      lead-based  paint  or  paint  of  unknown  lead  content  in a room in a
      multiple dwelling, or will involve the removal of two  or  more  windows
      with lead-based paint or paint of unknown lead content, such rules shall
      incorporate  work practices that are no less protective of public health
      than those set forth in subdivisions d and e of section  173.14  of  the
      health  code and those parts of subdivision b of such section applicable
      thereto, or a successor rule,  and  shall  include  a  requirement  that
      lead-contaminated  dust clearance testing be performed at the completion
      of such  work.  Such  rules  shall  also  require  temporary  relocation
      provided by the owner of the occupants of a dwelling or dwelling unit to
      appropriate  housing  when  work  cannot be performed safely. Such rules
      shall require, in addition, that all such  work  be  performed  only  by
      firms  which have received certification to perform lead abatement under
      the regulations issued by the  United  States  environmental  protection
      agency  at  subpart  L  of  part  745 of title 40 of the code of federal
    
      regulations  for  the  abatement  of  lead  hazards,  or  any  successor
      regulations.  Such  rules shall also provide that not less than ten days
      prior to the commencement of such work the owner of the premises, or the
      firm,  shall  file  with  the  department of health and mental hygiene a
      notice of commencement so that  the  department  of  health  and  mental
      hygiene may, at its discretion, perform sample audits of such notices to
      determine  that  the  firms  performing the work are properly certified.
      Such notice shall be signed by the owner or by a representative  of  the
      firm,  and  shall  be  in  a  form  satisfactory to or prescribed by the
      department of health and mental  hygiene,  and  shall  set  forth  at  a
      minimum the following information:
        (a)  The address of the multiple dwelling and the specific location of
      the work within the multiple dwelling.
        (b) The name, address  and  telephone  number  of  the  owner  of  the
      multiple dwelling in which the work is to be performed.
        (c)  The  name, address and telephone number of the firm which will be
      responsible for performing the work.
        (d) The date and time of commencement of the work,  working  or  shift
      hours, and the expected date of completion; and
        (e)  Identification  of the surfaces and structures, and surface area,
      subject to the work.
        The rules shall also provide  that  any  changes  in  the  information
      contained in the notice shall be filed with the department of health and
      mental  hygiene  prior  to  commencement of work, or if work has already
      commenced, within twenty-four hours  of  any  change.  The  rules  shall
      provide that a copy of the notice of commencement shall be posted at the
      work site.
        (iii) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply where such work
      disturbs surfaces of less than (a) two square feet of peeling lead-based
      paint  per  room or (b) ten percent of the total surface area of peeling
      paint on a type of component with a small surface area, such as a window
      sill or door frame.
        (3) where  an  owner  is  performing  work  on  turnover  pursuant  to
      27-2056.8  of this article. Such rules shall include, but not be limited
      to, requiring lead-contaminated dust clearance tests at  the  completion
      of such work.
        b.  No  person  shall  perform a lead-contaminated dust clearance test
      pursuant to this section unless such person is  a  third-party,  who  is
      independent  of  the  owner and any individual or firm that performs the
      work, and has successfully completed a course approved  or  administered
      by  the  department of health and mental hygiene or by the United States
      environmental protection agency  or  the  United  States  department  of
      housing  and  urban  development  and  obtained  a  certificate or other
      document issued by or acceptable to the department of health and  mental
      hygiene.
        c.  The  department, with the approval of the department of health and
      mental   hygiene,   shall   promulgate   rules   requiring   that    all
      lead-contaminated  dust  clearance  tests  submitted to a laboratory for
      analysis include a sworn certification that such test was  performed  in
      compliance  with  all applicable rules and regulations and shall include
      any additional  information  that  the  department  shall  determine  is
      necessary for the administration and enforcement of this section.
        d.  Where  an  owner  is  performing work pursuant to paragraph (1) of
      subdivision a of this section, all lead-contaminated dust clearance test
      results shall be filed with the department, and a copy shall be provided
      by the owner to the occupant of the dwelling unit.  Where  an  owner  is
      performing  work  pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision a of
      this section, a  copy  of  all  lead-contaminated  dust  clearance  test
    
      results  shall  be provided to the occupant of the dwelling unit. Copies
      of  lead-contaminated  dust  clearance  test  results  provided  to  the
      occupant  of the dwelling unit pursuant to this subparagraph shall be in
      a  form  satisfactory  to  or prescribed by the department of health and
      mental hygiene that provides a sufficiently  clear  explanation  of  the
      meaning of such results.

      available. The department of health  and  mental  hygiene,  pursuant  to
      section  17-179  of  this  code,  shall  refer  to  appropriate  medical
      providers any person who requests assistance in  blood  lead  screening,
      testing,  diagnosis  or  treatment,  and upon the request of a parent or
      guardian, arrange for blood lead screening of  any  child  who  requires
      screening  and  whose parent or guardian is unable to obtain a lead test
      because the child is uninsured or the child's insurance does  not  cover
      such screening.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2056.14
------------------

Section 27-2056.14 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2056.14  Inspections  by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
      and  Removal  of  Health  Code  Violations  by  Department  of   Housing
      Preservation  and  Development.  Whenever  a report has been made to the
      department of health and mental hygiene of a person under eighteen years
      of age with an elevated blood  lead  level  of  fifteen  micrograms  per
      deciliter  or  higher  residing  in any dwelling unit, the department of
      health and mental hygiene shall conduct such  investigation  as  may  be
      necessary  to  identify  potential  sources  of  the elevated blood lead
      level, including but not limited to, an inspection of the dwelling  unit
      where  such  person  resides.  If  the  department  of health and mental
      hygiene issues an order to correct  any  violation,  the  department  of
      health  and  mental hygiene shall notify the department of each dwelling
      unit in a dwelling for which the department of health and mental hygiene
      has issued an order to correct a  violation.  Where  the  owner  of  the
      dwelling  or relevant dwelling unit within such dwelling fails to comply
      with an order of the department of health and mental hygiene to  correct
      a  violation  placed by the department of health and mental hygiene, the

      article.
        (10)  "Peeling"  shall  mean  that  the paint or other surface-coating
      material is curling, cracking, scaling, flaking,  blistering,  chipping,
      chalking  or  loose in any manner, such that a space or pocket of air is
      behind a portion thereof or  such  that  the  paint  is  not  completely
      adhered to the underlying surface.
        (11)   "Remediation"  or  "Remediate"  shall  mean  the  reduction  or
      elimination of a lead-based paint hazard through the  wet  scraping  and
      repainting,   removal,   encapsulation,  enclosure,  or  replacement  of
      lead-based paint, or other method approved by the commissioner of health
      and mental hygiene.

        §   27-2056.4  Owners'  Responsibility  to  Notify  Occupants  and  to
      Investigate. a. In any dwelling unit  in  a  multiple  dwelling  erected
      prior  to  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty  where  a  child of
      applicable age resides, and in any dwelling unit in a multiple  dwelling
      erected  on  or  after  January first, nineteen hundred sixty and before
      January  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-eight  where  a   child   of
      applicable  age  resides  and  the  owner  has  actual  knowledge of the
      presence of lead-based paint, and  in  common  areas  of  such  multiple
      dwellings, the owner shall cause an investigation to be made for peeling
      paint,  chewable  surfaces,  deteriorated subsurfaces, friction surfaces
      and impact surfaces. Such investigation shall  be  undertaken  at  least
      once  a  year and more often if necessary, such as when, in the exercise
      of reasonable care, an owner knows or should have known of  a  condition
      that is reasonably foreseeable to cause a lead-based paint hazard, or an
      occupant  makes  a  complaint  concerning  a condition that is likely to
      cause a lead-based paint  hazard  or  requests  an  inspection,  or  the
      department  issues  a  notice of violation or orders the correction of a
      violation that is likely to cause a lead-based paint hazard.  The  owner
      shall  ascertain  whether  a  child  resides  therein  pursuant  to  the
      requirements of this section.
        b. No occupant in a dwelling unit  in  such  multiple  dwelling  shall
      refuse or unreasonably fail to provide accurate and truthful information
      regarding  the residency of a child of applicable age therein, nor shall
      an occupant refuse access to the owner at a  reasonable  time  and  upon
      reasonable prior notice to any part of the dwelling unit for the purpose
      of investigation and repair of lead-based paint hazards.
        c.  All  leases  offered  to  tenants  or  prospective tenants in such
      multiple dwellings  must  contain  a  notice,  conspicuously  set  forth
      therein,  which  advises  tenants  of  the  obligations of the owner and
      tenant as set forth in this section. Such notice must  be  in  a  manner
      approved by the department, the content of which shall, at a minimum, be
      in  English  and  Spanish.  The  owner  of  such multiple dwelling shall
      provide the  occupant  of  such  multiple  dwelling  with  the  pamphlet
      described in subdivision b of section 17-179 of this code.
        d.  (1)  The  owner  of  such  a multiple dwelling shall provide to an
      occupant of a dwelling unit at the  signing  of  a  lease,  including  a
      renewal  lease,  if  any,  or  upon  any  agreement  to lease, or at the
      commencement of occupancy if there is no lease, a notice in English  and
      Spanish,  the  form  and  content  of  which  shall  be  approved by the
      department of health and mental hygiene, inquiring whether  a  child  of
      applicable age resides or will reside therein. If there is a lease, such
      notice shall be included in such lease or be attached as a rider to such
      lease.  Such  notice  shall  be completed by the occupant at the time of
      such signing of a lease, including a renewal  lease,  if  any,  or  such
      agreement to lease, or at such commencement of occupancy.
        (2)  Where  an  occupant  has  responded to the notice provided by the
      owner pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision  d  of  this  section  by
      indicating  that  no child of applicable age resides therein, during the
      period between the date of such response and the delivery of the  notice
      provided  by  the owner pursuant to subdivision e of this section during
      the  immediately  following   year   the   occupant   shall   have   the
      responsibility  to  inform the owner of any child of applicable age that
      comes to reside therein during such period. In the event  such  occupant
      fails  to  inform the owner of such child as required by this paragraph,
      and the owner does not otherwise have actual knowledge that  such  child
      is  residing  in  the  dwelling  unit,  the  presumption provided for in
      section 27-2056.5 of this article shall  not  apply  in  any  action  to
    
      recover  damages  for personal injury caused by contact with or exposure
      to lead-based paint or lead-contaminated dust.
        e.  (1)  Each  year,  an owner of a multiple dwelling erected prior to
      January first, nineteen hundred sixty shall,  no  earlier  than  January
      first  and  no  later  than January sixteenth, except as provided for in
      subparagraph iii of paragraph two of this subdivision,  present  to  the
      occupant  of  each  dwelling  unit  in  such  multiple dwelling a notice
      inquiring as to whether a child of applicable age resides therein.  Such
      notice,  the  form  and  content  of  which  shall  be  approved  by the
      department of health and mental hygiene, shall be presented as  provided
      for  in  paragraph  two of this subdivision, and shall be in English and
      Spanish.
        (2) The owner may present the notice required by paragraph one of this
      subdivision by delivering said  notice  by  any  one  of  the  following
      methods:
        (i)  by  first  class  mail, addressed to the occupant of the dwelling
      unit;
        (ii) by hand delivery to the occupant of the dwelling unit;
        (iii) by enclosure with the January rent bill, if such  rent  bill  is
      delivered  after December fifteenth but no later than January sixteenth;
      or
        (iv) by delivering said notice in conjunction with the  annual  notice
      required  pursuant  to  section 17-123 of this code and the rules of the
      department of health and mental hygiene pertaining to  the  installation
      of window guards.
        (3)  (i)  Upon  receipt  of  such  notice  the occupant shall have the
      responsibility to deliver by February fifteenth of that year, a  written
      response  to  the  owner indicating whether or not a child of applicable
      age resides therein. If, subsequent to  delivery  of  such  notice,  the
      owner  does not receive such written response by February fifteenth, and
      does not otherwise have actual  knowledge  as  to  whether  a  child  of
      applicable age resides therein, then the owner shall at reasonable times
      and  upon  reasonable  notice  inspect  that occupant's dwelling unit to
      ascertain  the  residency  of  a  child  of  applicable  age  and,  when
      necessary, conduct an investigation in order to make that determination.
      Where,  between  February  sixteenth  and  March first of that year, the
      owner has made reasonable attempts to gain access to a dwelling unit  to
      determine if a child of applicable age resides in that dwelling unit and
      was  unable  to  gain  access,  the owner shall notify the department of
      health and mental hygiene of that circumstance.
        (ii) Where an occupant has responded to the  notice  provided  by  the
      owner  pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by indicating that
      no child of applicable age resides therein, during  the  period  between
      the date of such response and the delivery of the notice provided by the
      owner pursuant to this subdivision during the immediately following year
      the  occupant  shall  have the responsibility to inform the owner of any
      child of applicable age that comes to reside therein during such period.
      In the event such occupant fails to inform the owner of  such  child  as
      required by this paragraph, and the owner does not otherwise have actual
      knowledge  that  such  child  is  residing  in  the  dwelling  unit, the
      presumption provided for in section 27-2056.5 of this article shall  not
      apply  in  any  action  to recover damages for personal injury caused by
      contact with or exposure to lead-based paint or lead contaminated dust.
        (4) For calendar year two thousand four, an owner shall be  deemed  to
      have  satisfied  the  provisions of paragraphs one through three of this
      subdivision if such owner delivers or  has  already  delivered  to  each
      dwelling  unit  where  a  child  under six years of age resides a notice
      identical or  substantially  similar  to  that  required  to  have  been
    
      delivered in calendar year two thousand three, (i) in the same manner as
      was  required  in  calendar year two thousand three, and (ii) during the
      same periods of time in calendar year two thousand four as  such  notice
      was  required  to  have been delivered during calendar year two thousand
      three.
        f. The owner shall inform the occupant in writing of the results of an
      investigation undertaken pursuant to this section and  shall  provide  a
      copy  of  any such report received or generated by an investigation. The
      owner shall retain a copy of each investigation report,  for  ten  years
      from  the date of such report and such report shall be made available to
      the department on request and shall be transferred by the owner  to  the
      owner's successor in title.
        g. Any owner who violates the provisions of this section, or the rules
      promulgated  hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a
      fine of up to five hundred dollars or imprisonment for up to six  months
      or  both.  In  addition, any violation of this section shall subject the
      owner to a civil penalty of not more  than  one  thousand  five  hundred
      dollars per violation.
        h.  The  department  may,  at its discretion, perform sample audits to
      determine compliance with the requirements of this section.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-2056.5
-----------------

Section 27-2056.5 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2056.5 Presumption. a. In any multiple dwelling erected prior to
      January 1, 1960, it shall be presumed that the paint  or  other  similar
      surface-coating   material  in  any  dwelling  unit  where  a  child  of
      applicable age resides or in the common areas is lead-based  paint.  The
      presumption  established by this section may be rebutted by the owner of
      the dwelling or dwelling unit by submitting to the  department  a  sworn
      written  statement by the owner supported by lead-based paint testing or
      sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who  performed
      the  testing if performed by an employee or agent of the owner, and such
      other proof as the department may require. Testing  performed  to  rebut
      the presumption may only be performed by a person who has been certified
      as  an inspector or risk assessor in accordance with subparts L and Q of
      part 745 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations or any successor
      regulations. The determination as to whether such proof is  adequate  to
      rebut  the  presumption established by this section shall be made by the
      department.
        b. The owner of a dwelling  or  a  dwelling  unit  may  apply  to  the
      department  to  have  such  dwelling  or dwelling unit exempted from the
      presumption contained in subdivision a of this section when  either  (i)
      an  inspection  for  lead-based paint in such dwelling or dwelling unit,
      performed in accordance with section 745.227 of title 40 of the code  of
      federal  regulations,  or  any successor regulation, has determined that
      there is no lead-based paint present in such dwelling or dwelling  unit,
      or  (ii)  substantial  alterations  have  been  made to such dwelling or
      dwelling unit and such alterations  have  resulted  in  the  removal  or
      permanent  covering of all lead-based paint in that dwelling or dwelling
      unit. The department shall by rule determine the requirements needed  to
      qualify  for  such  an  exemption.  Sections  27-2056.4,  27-2056.8  and
      27-2056.9 of this article shall not apply to any  dwelling  or  dwelling
      unit that has been granted an exemption by the department.

        c.  The  department  is  not  required  to  undertake  the  procedures
      specified  in  this  section in a particular multiple dwelling if it has
      done so in such building during the prior twelve month period.

Section 27-2056.9
-----------------

Section 27-2056.9 ::    
        
     
        §  27-2056.9  Department Inspections. a. When entering a dwelling unit
      in a multiple dwelling constructed prior to  January  1,  1960  for  the
      purpose  of  investigating  the existence of any violation of this code,
      the department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a  child
      of applicable age resides therein and shall request from the occupant an
      acknowledgement as to whether such a child resides in the dwelling unit.
      Whenever  a  child  of  applicable  age  resides in a dwelling unit, the
      department shall immediately perform a room-by-room  inspection  of  the
      dwelling  unit  and  record for each room in a report of such inspection
      whether the paint or other similar surface-coating material in each room
      is peeling or intact. For each room where peeling paint  is  found,  the
      department  shall  also inspect for evidence of an underlying defect and
      shall indicate on the inspection report  the  peeling  paint's  location
      within  the  room,  the  condition  of  the subsurface below it, and the
      location of any underlying defect. When performing such inspection,  the
      department  need  only inspect those portions of the dwelling unit where
      furniture or other furnishings do not obstruct the view  of  a  surface,
      except  when  there  is  visible  evidence that causes the department to
      believe that the obstructed  surface  has  peeling  paint.  Where,  upon
      conducting  an  inspection, the department determines the existence of a
      condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall
      serve a notice of violation within ten additional days.
        b. In any dwelling unit  in  a  multiple  dwelling  erected  prior  to
      January  1, 1960 where a child of applicable age resides, the department
      shall conduct an inspection pursuant to subdivision a of this section no
      later than ten days  after  the  department's  receipt  of  a  complaint
      describing  peeling  paint,  or  a deteriorated subsurface or underlying
      defect in the dwelling unit. The department shall make diligent  efforts
      to  ascertain  whether  a child of applicable age resides therein. Where
      the department attempts to perform an  inspection  of  a  dwelling  unit
      within  the  time  period  required by this subdivision but is unable to
      gain access, the department shall  be  required  to  make  a  reasonable
      attempt  to  gain  access to such dwelling unit within five days of such
      attempt. If the department is unable to gain  access  to  that  dwelling
      unit  during  this  additional time period, the department shall provide
      written notice to the occupant of such dwelling  unit  that  no  further
      attempts at access shall be made unless a new complaint is submitted.
        c. Each inspector who performs an inspection pursuant to subdivision b
      of  this  section  shall  use  an x-ray fluorescence analyzer during the
      course of that inspection  to  determine  whether  lead-based  paint  is
      present  in  such  dwelling  unit  except  that,  for reasons beyond the
      control of the department, such x-ray fluorescence analysis is unable to
      be performed during such inspection, the department shall  rely  on  the
      presumption  set  forth  in  subdivision  a of section 27-2056.5 of this
      article. Where peeling paint is found during an inspection of a dwelling
      unit performed pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the department
      shall within ten days thereafter  perform  another  inspection  of  such
      dwelling  unit using an x-ray fluorescence analyzer to determine whether
      lead-based  paint  is  present  in  such  dwelling  unit.  Where,   upon
      conducting  an  inspection, the department determines the existence of a
      condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall
      serve a notice of violation within ten additional days.
        d. The pamphlet developed by  the  department  of  health  and  mental
      hygiene  pursuant  to  section  17-179 of this code shall be left at the
      premises of the dwelling unit at the time of an inspection made  by  the
      department pursuant to this section.
        e.  The department shall develop a pamphlet listing the work practices
      to be established pursuant to section 27-2056.11 of this  article.  Such
    
      pamphlet  shall  be  delivered by the department in conjunction with all
      notices of violation issued pursuant to paragraph one of  subdivision  l
      of  section  27-2115 of this code. Failure to include such pamphlet with
      such  notices of violation shall not render null and void the service of
      such notices of violation. Such pamphlet shall also be made available to
      any member of the public upon request.
        f.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  failure  by  the
      department or the department of health and mental hygiene to comply with
      any  time  period  provided  in  this article or section 27-2115 of this
      chapter  relating  to  responsibilities  of  the  department   and   the
      department  of health and mental hygiene, shall not render null and void
      any notice of violation issued by the department or  the  department  of
      health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall
      not  provide  a  basis for defense or mitigation of an owner's liability
      for civil penalties for violation of such article.
