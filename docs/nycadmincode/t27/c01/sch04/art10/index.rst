      delineated in reference standard RS4-4, applications for  permits  shall
      be subject to the following:
        (a)  Permissible  uses and other measures to reduce flood losses shall
      take precedence over any conflicting laws.
        (b) Major repairs or alterations shall be with construction  materials
      and  utility  equipment  that  are  resistant  to  flood damage, and use
      construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
        (c) New and proposed construction or substantial improvements shall be
      protected against flood damage, be designed (or modified)  and  anchored
      to  prevent  flotation,  collapse or lateral movements of the structure,
      use construction materials and utility equipment that are  resistant  to
      flood  damage,  and  use  construction  methods  and practices that will
      minimize flood damage.
        (d) New and proposed  developments  and  construction  shall  minimize
      flood damage, locate, elevate and construct all public utilities such as
      gas,  sewer, electrical and water systems to minimize or eliminate flood
      damage, and provide adequate drainage so as to reduce exposure to  flood
      hazards.
        (e)  New  or  replacement  water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage
      systems shall be designed  to  minimize  or  eliminate  infiltration  of
      floodwaters  into  the  systems,  and  discharges  from the systems into
      floodwaters, and require on-site disposal systems to be located so as to
      avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding.
        (f) Subdivision proposals and  other  proposed  new  developments  and

Section 27-317 ::    
        
     
        §  27-317  Occupancy and construction restrictions. (a) Within special
      flood hazard areas, as delineated  in  reference  standard  RS  4-4,  no
      building  in  occupancy  group  classification  J1,  J2  or  J3 shall be
      constructed or altered so as to have the lowest  floor  below  the  base
      flood elevation.
        (b)  New  construction  or substantial improvements of non-residential
      buildings within special flood hazard areas, as delineated in  reference
      standard  RS  4-4,  shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the
      base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utilities and sanitary
      facilities, shall be floodproofed up to the  level  of  the  base  flood
      elevation,  in  accordance with the requirement of reference standard RS
      4-5.  Provided,  however,   that   new   construction   or   substantial
      improvements of non-residential buildings within area designated as Zone
      V   in  reference  standard  RS  4-4  shall  meet  the  requirements  of
      subdivision (f) of this section.
        (c) Any encroachment in  the  floodway,  as  delineated  in  reference
      standard   RS   4-4,   including  fill,  new  construction,  substantial
      improvement, or any other development that would result in any  increase
      in  flood  levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
      flood discharge, shall be prohibited.
        (d) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse
      or lateral movement and shall be elevated on a permanent  foundation  to
      or  above  the base flood elevation or, when no base flood elevation has
      been determined, two feet above the highest adjacent grade.  Methods  of
      anchoring  may  include,  but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or
      frame ties to ground anchors. No park trailers or travel trailers  shall
      be  permitted  within  special  flood  hazard  areas,  as  delineated in
      reference standard RS 4-4.
        (e) In the case of alterations constituting a substantial  improvement
      to  parts  of  non-residential and non-institutional buildings below the
      base flood elevation, all parts below  the  base  flood  elevation  need
      comply with the applicable requirements of reference standard RS 4-5.
        (f)  All  new  construction  and substantial improvements of buildings
      within Zone V, as delineated in reference  standard  RS  4-4,  shall  be
      performed  pursuant  to  the provisions of RS 4-5. Such construction and
      improvements shall have the lowest floor elevated on adequately anchored
      pilings or columns and securely anchored to such  piles  or  columns  to
      prevent  flotation,  collapse  or  lateral  movement  resulting from the
      simultaneous action of wind and water loads on all building  components,
      and  the  lowest  portion of the structural members of the lowest floor,
      other than the pilings or columns, shall be elevated  to  or  above  the
      base  flood  elevation. For purposes of this subdivision, wind and water
      loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equalled or
      exceeded in any given year (one hundred year mean recurrence  interval).
      In addition:
        (1) The installation of anchoring to anchored pilings or columns shall
      be subject to controlled inspection.
        (2)  The space below the lowest floor shall be free of obstruction or,
      alternatively, such space shall be constructed with break-away walls  of
      an  open  lattice  type construction which is intended to collapse under
      stress  from  abnormally  high  tides  or  wind  driven  water   without
      jeopardizing  the  structural  support of the building. Such space shall
      not be used for human habitation.
        (3) The use of fill for structural support of buildings within Zone  V
      shall not be permitted.
        (4)  The  man-made  alteration of sand dunes within Zone V which would
      increase potential flood damage to buildings shall not be permitted.
    
        (5) All new construction within Zone V shall be  located  landward  of
      the reach of mean high tide.
        (g)  All  new  construction  and substantial improvements of buildings
      within Zone A, as delineated in  reference  standard  RS  4-4  shall  be
      performed pursuant to the provisions of reference standard RS 4-5. Where
      such construction or improvement is not floodproofed, any fully enclosed
      space  below the lowest floor that is subject to flooding, as defined in
      section 27-317.1 of this code, shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic
      flood  forces   on   exterior   walls   automatically   (without   human
      intervention)  by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Design
      for  meeting  this  requirement  shall  be  certified  by  a  registered
      architect  or licensed professional engineer or shall meet or exceed the
      following minimum criteria:
        (1) A minimum of two openings, having a total net  area  of  not  less
      than  one square inch for every square foot of enclosed space subject to
      flooding, shall be provided.
        (2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot  above
      grade.
        (3)  Openings  may  be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
      coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic  entry  and
      exit of floodwaters.
        (h)  When  used  within  special  flood hazard areas, as delineated in
      reference standard RS 4-4, breakaway walls  shall  have  a  design  safe
      loading  resistance  of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds
      per square foot. Use of a breakaway wall which  exceeds  a  design  safe
      loading  resistance  of twenty pounds per square foot shall be permitted
      only  if  a  registered  architect  or  licensed  professional  engineer
      certifies that the proposed design meets the following conditions:
        (1)  Breakaway  wall  collapse will result from a water load less than
      that which would occur during the base flood; and
        (2) the elevated portion of the  building  and  supporting  foundation
      system   will  not  be  subject  to  collapse,  displacement,  or  other
      structural damage due to the effects of  wind  and  water  loads  acting
      simultaneously    on    all    building   components   (structural   and
      non-structural). Maximum wind and water  loading  values  used  in  this
      determination  shall each have a one percent chance of being equalled or
      exceeded in any given year (one hundred year mean recurrence interval).

      member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of
      pilings,  columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow
      of water, and (ii) adequately anchored so that the structural  integrity
      of  such  building is not impaired during a flood of up to the magnitude
      of the base flood. In an area designated as Zone A in reference standard
      RS 4-4, such term also includes a building elevated by means of fill  or
      solid  foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to permit the
      unimpeded movement of flood waters. In an area designated as Zone  V  in

      structure.
        LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest level including cellar  or  basement  of  the
      lowest  enclosed area. For the purpose of this article, an unfinished or
      flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the  parking  of  vehicles,
      building  access  or  storage  in  an area other than a basement, is not
      considered a structure's lowest  floor,  provided  that  such  enclosure
      shall  not  be  built  so as to render the structure in violation of the
      requirements of subdivision (g) of section 27-317 of this code.
        MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
      which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be  used  with  or
      without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.

      repair,  reconstruction,  placement or substantial improvement is within
      one hundred eighty days of such date. "Actual start"  means  either  the
      first  placement of permanent construction of a building on a site, such
      as pile driving, the pouring of slabs or footings, or  any  work  beyond
      the  stage  of excavation; or, for a building without a cellar, basement
      or poured footings, the first permanent  framing  or  assembly  of  such
      building  or  any  part thereof on its piling or foundations. "Permanent
      construction" does not  include  land  preparation,  such  as  clearing,
      grading  and  filling;  nor  does  it  include  excavation for a cellar,
      basement, footings, piers or foundations or the  erection  of  temporary
      forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory

        (2) if the building has been damaged and is being restored before such
      damage occurred.
        For the purposes of  this  definition,  "substantial  improvement"  is
      considered  to  occur  when  the  first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
      floor or other structural parts of the building  commences,  whether  or
      not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The
      term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either:
    
        (1)  any project for improvement of a building to comply with state or
      local health, sanitary or safety code specifications  which  are  solely
      necessary to assure safe conditions, or
        (2)  any alteration of a building designated as worthy of preservation
      because of historic or architectural importance, or a building within an
      area so designated by the landmarks preservation commission,  or  listed
      on  the  national  register  of  historic  places  or state inventory of
      historic places.
        ZONE A. A symbol used on the flood insurance rate map to designate  an
      area  of  special  flood hazard without velocity (wave action). When not
      shown on the flood insurance rate map, the water surface  elevation  may
      be  determined  from  available  data  by  the  registered  architect or
      licensed professional engineer of record.
        ZONE V. A symbol used on the flood insurance rate map to designate  an
      area of special flood hazard with velocity (wave action). When not shown
      on  the  flood  insurance  rate  map, the water surface elevation may be
      determined from available data by the registered architect  or  licensed
      professional engineer of record.
