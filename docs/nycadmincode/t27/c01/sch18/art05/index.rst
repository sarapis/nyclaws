        § 27-1005 Operators. Every power driven passenger elevator and freight
      elevator  with a rise of more than one story, except automatic operation
      and continuous pressure elevators and sidewalk elevators,  shall  be  in
      charge  of  a  designated  competent  operator,  who  shall  be at least
      eighteen years old, free from serious physical or  mental  defects,  and
      selected  with  consideration  of his or her abilities to perform his or
      her duties  in  a  careful  and  competent  manner,  and  who  has  been
      instructed  in  accordance  with  the  requirements of the commissioner,
      except as otherwise specifically provided by law. Operators of amusement
      devices that require the services of a  regular  operator  shall  be  at
      least  eighteen  years  of  age  and shall have secured a certificate of
      competence from the commissioner. If the  commissioner  finds  that  any
      person  engaged  in  running  an  elevator  or  amusement  device is not
      competent to operate the elevator or device, the owner, agent or  lessee
      of  such  elevator  or  amusement  device  shall,  upon  notice from the
      commissioner, discontinue the operation of such  elevator  or  amusement
      device  by  such  operator.  Other devices listed in article one of this
      subchapter shall, when deemed  necessary  by  the  commissioner,  be  in
      charge   of   a   designated   competent  operator  conforming  to  such
      qualifications as the commissioner may prescribe except  that  operators
      for  workers'  hoists  shall  be  assigned as required by the applicable
      provisions of reference standard RS 18-7.

Section 27-1006 ::    
        
     
        § 27-1006 Accidents. The owner or person in charge of the equipment or
      devices  listed  in article one of this subchapter shall promptly notify
      the commissioner of  every  accident  involving  injury  to  any  person
      requiring  the  services  of  a  physician  or  damage to property or to
      apparatus exceeding one hundred dollars on, about, or in connection with
      such equipment, and shall afford the  commissioner  every  facility  for
      investigating  such  accident  or damage. The commissioner shall make an
      investigation immediately thereafter,  and  shall  prepare  a  full  and
      complete  report of such investigation. Such report shall give in detail
      all material facts and information available and the cause or causes  as
      far  as  they  can  be  determined.  Such report shall be open to public
      inspection at all  reasonable  hours.  When  an  accident  involves  the
      failure  or  destruction  of  any  part of the construction or operating
      mechanism of such equipment, no such equipment shall be  used  until  it
      has  been  made  safe,  and  re-inspected  by  the commissioner; and the
      commissioner may order the discontinuance of such equipment until a  new
      use  permit  has been issued by him or her for its use. No part shall be
      removed from the premises  of  the  damaged  construction  or  operating
      mechanism   until   permission   to  do  so  has  been  granted  by  the
      commissioner.
