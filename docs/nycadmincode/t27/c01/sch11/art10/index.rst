Section 27-707 ::    
        
     
        §  27-707  Timber  piles. (a) Materials. Timber piles shall conform in
      quality to class A or B of reference standard RS 11-7.
        (1) SIZE OF PILES. Piles shall be  of  adequate  size  to  resist  the
      applied  loads without creating stresses in the pile materials in excess
      of twelve hundred psi for piles of southern pine, Douglas fir,  oak,  or
      other  wood of comparable strength; or eight hundred fifty psi for piles
      of cedar, Norway pine, spruce or  other  wood  of  comparable  strength.
      Except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, for piles forty
      feet  or  more  in  length  and  of  thirty  tons  capacity or less, the
      following sizes or classes of piles shall be deemed to be  adequate  for
      considerations of stress in the pile material:
        a.  Piles  of  twenty-five to thirty tons capacity--Class A or minimum
      eight inch tip with uniform taper.
        b. Piles of less than twenty-five  tons  capacity--Class  A  or  B  or
      minimum six inch tip with uniform taper.
        (2)  PILES  DRIVEN  TO  END  BEARING.  All timber piles, regardless of
      capacity, driven to end bearing on soils of classes  1-65  through  5-65
      shall  be  class  A or shall have a minimum eight inch tip and a uniform
      taper.
        (3) SPECIES OF WOOD. Any species of wood may be used that conforms  to
      the  provisions  of  reference  standard RS 11-7 and that will stand the
      driving stresses.
        (4) PEELING. Unless treated, piles need not be peeled.
        (b) Limitations on use. Where timber piles are to  be  driven  to  end
      bearing  on  soils  of  classes  1-65  through  5-65 by use of an impact
      hammer, the installation of each such pile shall be under  the  personal
      supervision  of  an architect or engineer, and the operations of driving
      such  piles,  the  observations  of  penetration  resistance,  and   the
      operation of the equipment shall be so conducted as to terminate driving
      directly  when  the pile reaches bearing on the hard material. A report,
      prepared by  the  architect  or  engineer,  describing  the  procedures,
      equipment,  and  precautions  followed  to  prevent injury to the piling
      shall be submitted to the commissioner.
        (c) Lagged and inverted piles. The use of  lagged  or  inverted  piles
      will  be  permitted. Double lagging shall be adequately connected to the
      basic pile material to transfer the full pile load from the  basic  pile
      material  to the lagging without exceeding values of allowable stress as
      established in subchapter ten of this chapter. The connection for single
      lagging shall be proportioned for half the pile load.  The  diameter  of
      any  inverted timber pile at any section shall be adequate to resist the
      applied load without exceeding the stresses indicated in  paragraph  one
      of subdivision (a) of this section, but in no case shall it be less than
      eight inches.
        (d) Installation.
        (1)  All  broomed, crushed, or otherwise damaged materials at the head
      of the piles shall be removed before capping.
        (2) Any sudden decrease in driving resistance  shall  be  investigated
      with  regard  to  the  possibility  of breakage of the pile, and if such
      sudden decrease in driving resistance cannot  be  correlated  to  boring
      data  or some incident in the driving, and if the pile cannot be removed
      for inspection, it shall be considered as adequate cause  for  rejection
      of the pile.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-708
--------------

Section 27-708 ::    
        
     
        §  27-708 Precast concrete piles (including prestressed sections). (a)
      Materials. Materials for precast concrete piles  shall  conform  to  the
      requirements of article five of subchapter ten of this chapter.
        (b) Construction.
        (1)  HANDLING.  Precast  concrete  piles  shall be proportioned, cast,
      cured, handled, and driven so as  to  resist  the  stresses  induced  by
      handling  and  driving  as  well as by loads. Handling stresses shall be
      computed on the basis of fifty per cent of the weight of the pile as  an
      allowance  for  impact. Handling equipment shall be constructed so as to
      equalize the reactions on the several lines of the pile pickups. Loading
      conditions induced by handling and driving shall  be  considered  as  of
      infrequent occurrence.
        (2) DIMENSIONS. The minimum lateral dimension of the pile shall be ten
      inches, except for the taper at the tip.
        (3)  STRUCTURAL DESIGN. Piles shall be proportioned in accordance with
      the provisions of article eight  of  this  subchapter,  subject  to  the
      following additional requirements:
        a.  For  a  length  equal  to at least three times the minimum lateral
      dimension at each end of the pile, lateral tie reinforcement  consisting
      of 0.225 in. diameter rods or larger shall be spaced not more than three
      inches  center-to-center,  or  an  equivalent  spiral shall be provided.
      Elsewhere, the spacing of the ties or the pitch of  the  spiral  may  be
      increased   to   twelve   inches  The  minimum  amount  of  longitudinal
      reinforcement shall be two per cent of the concrete section placed in  a
      symmetrical  pattern  of  at  least  four bars. If prestressed piles are
      used, the minimum residual compression in  the  pile  section  shall  be
      seven hundred psi. For piles designed with voids, the three inch spacing
      of  the  ties  or spiral at each end of the pile shall be extended for a
      distance of twelve feet or one-third the length of the  pile,  whichever
      is smaller.
        b.  For  piles  designed with voids, the minimum wall thickness of the
      concrete in any section of the piles shall be  four  inches.  Voids  may
      extend  through  either  or  both  ends of the pile. If the void extends
      through the lower end of the pile, the pile  head  shall  be  vented  to
      prevent buildup of internal hydraulic pressure during driving.
        c.  Reinforcing  steel shall be covered with at least one and one-half
      inches of concrete on the surface against the ground.
        (c)  Tolerances.  Voids,  when   used,   shall   be   located   within
      three-eighths of an inch of the position shown in the plans. The maximum
      departure of the pile axis from a straight line, measured while the pile
      is not subject to bending forces, shall not exceed one-eighth of an inch
      in  ten  feet or three eighths of an inch in forty feet, or 0.1 per cent
      of the pile length.
        (d) Installation. Precast concrete  piles  shall  not  be  handled  or
      driven  until  they  have  cured  sufficiently  to develop the necessary
      strength.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-709
--------------

Section 27-709 ::    
        
     
        §  27-709 Cast-in-place concrete piles. (a) Description. Cast-in-place
      concrete piles shall be cast  in  shells  previously  installed  in  the
      ground  or,  with the limitations indicated in section 27-697 of article
      seven of this subchapter, may be cast in an uncased hole.  Cast-in-place
      piles  may  be  tapered  or cylindrical, or a combination of tapered and
      cylindrical shapes.
        (b) Materials. Concrete for cast-in-place concrete piles shall conform
      to the requirements of article five of subchapter ten of  this  chapter.
      Slump  shall be five inches plus or minus one inch. Where the pile shell
      is assumed to contribute to the capacity of the  pile  as  a  structural
      member,  the shell shall be of metal and shall conform to the provisions
      of article six of subchapter ten of this chapter or  section  27-712  of
      this  article.  Where the pile shell is not assumed to contribute to the
      capacity of the pile as a structural member, the shell  may  be  of  any
      material  that  will adequately resist the driving stresses and maintain
      an open well to receive the concrete. End closures for shells shall  not
      project more than one-half inch beyond the outer limits of the pile when
      bearing in soils of class 6-65 or lower.
        (c) Installation.
        (1)  After  installation to final depth and immediately before filling
      with concrete,  the  inside  of  the  tube,  shell,  or  bore  shall  be
      thoroughly  cleaned to the bottom and inspected by lowering a drop light
      or by means of a light beam. To be accepted: (a) the pile shall be  free
      of  collapsed  sections  of  shell and the pile shell shall not show any
      tears; (b) the pile shall be free of water except that a minor amount of
      water may be allowed to occur in the pile if it be absorbed by placing a
      suitable amount of dry cement-sand mixture in the tip end of  the  pile;
      and  (c)  the  alignment  of the pile shall conform to the provisions of
      section 27-691 of article seven of this subchapter. If the bottom of the
      casing is out of sight, the shape and alignment of the casing  shall  be
      surveyed with a suitable instrument, or the pile rejected.
        (2) Concrete shall be placed by such methods that the entire volume of
      the  tube,  shell,  or bore is filled and in a manner that will preclude
      separation of the ingredients.
        (3) No concrete shall be placed in  a  cast-in-place  pile  until  all
      piles  within  a radius of fifteen feet, or within the heave range, have
      been driven.
        (4) Rejected pile shells shall be filled with concrete or sand.
        (5) The concrete cap shall not be placed until at least one hour after
      all piles within the cap group are completely filled.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-710
--------------

Section 27-710 ::    
        
     
        §  27-710  Compacted  concrete  piles.  (a)  Description. A "compacted
      concrete pile" shall denote a concrete pile formed with an enlarged base
      in which the concrete in the base is placed in small  batches  that  are
      compacted  prior  to attaining an initial set. The concrete in the shaft
      of the pile shall be placed as  specified  in  section  27-709  of  this
      article  for  cast-in-place  concrete  piles  if  a permanent casting is
      provided, or in small batches that are compacted.
        (b) Materials. Concrete for compacted concrete piles shall conform  to
      the  requirements  of  article  five  of subchapter ten of this chapter.
      Concrete to be compacted shall have a minimum  compressive  strength  at
      the  age  of  twenty-eight  days of four thousand psi and shall be mixed
      with sufficient water to permit hydration of the cement, but  the  slump
      shall be zero. The concrete shall be placed and compacted before initial
      set  can  occur.  Non-compacted  concrete,  if used for the pile shafts,
      shall conform to the requirements for cast-in-place concrete piles.
        (c) Spacing. Minimum spacing between compacted concrete piles shall be
      four feet six inches, center to center except that where the  shafts  of
      such  piles are cased for their full length, this spacing may be reduced
      to three feet six inches. Where a question exists as to possible  damage
      to adjacent previously driven piles, these minimums shall be increased.
        (d) Installation.
        (1)  The  base  shall  be  formed  by  ramming concrete, in batches of
      approximately five cubic feet or less, from a drive casing and into  the
      soil.  Unless  specifically  otherwise  permitted by the commissioner, a
      minimum  of  twenty  blows  of  at  least  one  hundred  forty  thousand
      foot-pounds  per  blow  shall be required for extrusion of the last five
      cubic feet of concrete. The total quantity of concrete extruded from the
      drive casing to form the base shall be equal  to  or  greater  than  the
      quantity  so  extruded  in the case of the nearest successful applicable
      test pile, except that a compactive effort in excess  of  thirty  blows,
      each of one hundred forty thousand foot-pounds, will not be required for
      extrusion of the last five cubic feet.
        (2)  After  the  expanded  base  has  been  formed, the shaft shall be
      constructed. Where a cased shaft is to be used, a steel shell  shall  be
      inserted  into  the  drive  casing  and anchored to the expanded base by
      placing a fresh charge of concrete in the shell and driving it into  the
      base.  The  shell  may then be filled with concrete to cut-off elevation
      after the removal of the drive casing, in accordance with the provisions
      relating to cast-in-place concrete piles. Any  annular  space  remaining
      between  the  shell  and  surrounding  soil  shall be suitably filled to
      assure proper lateral support of the shaft, unless there  is  sufficient
      recovery  of  the  ground  to  provide  the  necessary support. Where an
      uncased shaft is to be used, the provisions of section 27-697 of article
      seven of this subchapter shall apply, and the  concrete  for  the  shaft
      shall be placed by ramming or by the use of approved pressure devices as
      the  drive  casing  is  withdrawn.  Where  ramming is used, the concrete
      batches being rammed shall not exceed five cubic  feet  in  volume,  not
      less than two blows of thirty thousand foot-pounds each shall be applied
      to  compact  each  batch of concrete, and the bottom of the drive casing
      shall be kept below the level of the concrete at all times.
        (3) The outside diameter of the permanent shaft shall not be more than
      four inches less than the inside diameter of the drive casing.
        (4) Except where uncased shafts are  used,  as  described  in  section
      27-697  of article seven of this subchapter, no concrete shall be placed
      in the pile shafts until all piles within a radius of fifteen  feet,  or
      within the heave range, have been driven.
        (e)  Bearing  material.  The enlarged base of the pile shall be formed
      in, or on the same type of bearing material as is used  to  support  the
    
      nearest  applicable  load  test  pile and at a similar depth therein. In
      addition, the enlarged base shall be underlain by a minimum depth of ten
      feet (measured from  the  junction  of  the  shaft  and  base)  of  soil
      materials  of  classes  1-65 to 7-65, except that, where installation of
      the base is permitted to be performed with blows of less energy than the
      one hundred forty thousand foot-pounds indicated  in  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision (d) of this section, the requirement for a ten foot depth of
      class  1-65  to 7-65 material may be reduced, subject to the approval of
      the architect or engineer and the aproval of the commissioner.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-711
--------------

Section 27-711 ::    
        
     
        §  27-711  Steel H sections. (a) Materials. Steel H sections may be of
      any type of steel permitted by the provisions of reference  standard  RS
      10-5.    The use of built-up sections or sections of other than "H" form
      will  be  permitted  if  the  several  components  of  the  section  are
      adequately  connected to develop the strength of the adjacent components
      and if the ratio of width to thickness of the component parts  does  not
      exceed the values for conventional "H" sections.
        (b)  Limitations  on  use.  The  tips  of  all  steel H piles having a
      thickness of metal less than one-half inch,  which  are  driven  to  end
      bearing on rock of class 1-65 through 3-65 by an impact hammer, shall be
      reinforced.  The  installation  of all steel H piles by impact hammer to
      end bearing on rock of classes 1-65 through  3-65  shall  be  under  the
      personal  inspection  of an architect or engineer, and the operations of
      driving such piles, the observations of penetration resistance, and  the
      operation of the equipment shall be conducted so as to terminate driving
      directly when the pile reaches refusal on the rock surface.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-712
--------------

Section 27-712 ::    
        
     
        §  27-712  Concrete-filled  pipe  piles. (a) Materials. The pipe shall
      conform to the provisions of reference standard RS 11-8. Concrete  shall
      conform  to  the  requirements of article five of subchapter ten of this
      chapter.
        (b) Minimum dimensions. (1)  Pipe  installed  open-end  and  having  a
      nominal  outside diameter of less than fourteen inches shall be at least
      one-quarter inch thick. For diameters from fourteen inches  to  eighteen
      inches,  the  minimum  thickness  shall  be 0.310 in. For diameters over
      eighteen inches, the minimum thickness shall be 0.375 in.
        (2) Steel pipe piles installed with ends closed shall have  a  minimum
      nominal wall thickness of at least 0.125 in.
        (3)  For  piles  which  receive  their  principal support by friction,
      closure or splice plates shall not project more than three-eighths of an
      inch beyond the outer limit of the pipe section.
        (c) Installation.
        (1) Pipe shells driven open-end shall be cleaned to the bottom of  the
      shell after driving.
        (2)  After driving and cleaning the pipe, open-end piles driven to end
      bearing on rock  or  hardpan  shall  be  reseated  to  full  bearing  by
      redriving,  to the resistance indicated in table 11-4. If the pipe shell
      shows two inches or more of penetration on redriving, the pipe shall  be
      recleaned  and  redriven  in  successive cycles until the penetration on
      redriving is less than two inches.
        (3) Pipe shells shall be inspected before filling with concrete, shall
      be clean, and shall meet the requirements for alignment and condition of
      the shell as specified with regard to the shells of cast-in-place piles.
      If leakage of water into the pipe occurs, the  provisions  of  paragraph
      five of subdivision (e) of section 27-713 of this article shall apply.
        (4)  Placing  of  concrete  fill  in  pipe shells shall conform to the
      requirements for placing concrete fill in cast-in-place piles.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-713
--------------

Section 27-713 ::    
        
     
        §  27-713  Caisson  piles. (a) Description. Caisson piles shall denote
      concrete filled pipe piles that are  socketed  into  bedrocks  of  class
      1-65, 2-65 or 3-65 and constructed with steel cores.
        (b)  Materials.  Pipe  or  shell  and  concrete  shall  conform to the
      requirements for concrete filled pipe piles,  except  that  the  minimum
      compressive  strength  of  the  concrete at the age of twenty-eight days
      shall be thirty-five hundred psi.  Steel  cores  shall  conform  to  the
      requirements for steel H piles. Reinforcing steel cages shall be covered
      with at least one and one-half inches of concrete.
        (c)  Design  of  rock  socket.  The design of the rock socket shall be
      predicated on the sum of the allowable bearing pressure on the bottom of
      the socket plus bond along  the  sides  of  the  socket.  The  allowable
      bearing  pressure on the surface of the rock at the bottom of the socket
      shall be as established in  section  27-678  of  article  four  of  this
      subchapter  increased  for  embedment  in  accordance with note eight of
      table 11-2, provided that the strength  of  the  concrete  fill  in  the
      socket,  computed  as  0.45f'c is of comparable magnitude. The allowable
      bond stress between the concrete and the sides of the  socket  shall  be
      taken  as  two hundred psi. The provisions of subdivision (c) of section
      27-700 of article eight  of  this  subchapter  relative  to  penetration
      resistance shall not apply.
        (d) Spacing and minimum dimensions.
        (1)  Minimum  diameter  of  a  caisson shall be eighteen inches with a
      minimum shell thickness of three-eighths of an inch.  Minimum  depth  of
      the rock socket shall be equal to the diameter of the pipe.
        (2) The center-to-center spacing of caissons shall be at least two and
      one-half times the outside diameter of the shell.
        (e) Installation.
        (1)  The  steel  shell  shall  be  installed  through  overburden, the
      material within the shell shall be removed, and the shell seated in  the
      rock  sufficiently  to stop the inflow of soil. Where required to extend
      the shells, splices are to be welded.  A  suitable  steel  driving  shoe
      shall be welded to the bottom of each caisson.
        (2)  A  socket shall then be drilled in the rock to the required depth
      and shall be approximately of the same diameter as the  inside  diameter
      of  the  shell. Before placement of concrete, the socket and shell shall
      be thoroughly cleaned and the rock inspected to verify that the rock  is
      of  the  class  on  which the design has been predicated, or of a better
      class.  In case visual inspection cannot be made because of inability to
      unwater the caissons by standard  pumping  methods,  drilling  logs  and
      screenings from the rock drilling operation may be utilized to determine
      the class of rock in the socket.
        (3)  Where more than one section of steel core is required, the mating
      ends of the sections shall be spliced so  as  to  safely  withstand  the
      handling  stresses  to  which  they  may be subjected. The ends shall be
      milled or field ground to  insure  contact.  The  steel  core  shall  be
      centrally installed in the caisson before grouting and concreting, shall
      not  be  more  than one inch above the rock at the bottom of the socket,
      and shall be full length of the caisson or extend a sufficient  distance
      up  into  the  shaft  to  transmit  the  load in the steel core into the
      concrete of the caisson. A minimum-weight thirty-six  pounds  stub  core
      beam  shall  be installed in the socket for caissons not requiring steel
      cores in order to lock the caissons into the rock. In these  cases,  the
      length of the steel cores shall be twice the socket depth.
        (4) Concrete and grout shall be placed so that it completely fills the
      shell,  the  socket, and the space between the steel core and shell, and
      in a manner that will preclude separation of the ingredients.
    
        (5) If the leakage of water into the caisson  is  minor,  the  caisson
      shall  be  pumped out and one cubic yard of grout shall be placed in the
      caissons and then the balance of the concrete installed. If the  leakage
      of  water  makes it inadvisable to attempt to place concrete in the dry,
      the  shell shall be filled to its top with clean water, and the concrete
      placed by the tremie method to the top of the caisson in one  continuous
      operation  or  by  using  a  seal  of  grout of the same strength as the
      specified concrete. The grout seal, if used, shall be deposited by means
      of a grout pipe to an elevation of at least three feet above the cutting
