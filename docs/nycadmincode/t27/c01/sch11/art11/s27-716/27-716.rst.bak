        §  27-716  Use  of  rock  support  in  lieu  of underpinning. Existing
      structures  founded  at  a  level  above  the  level  of  adjacent   new
      construction  may be supported on hard rock in lieu of underpinning, the
      use of sheeting and bracing, or the  construction  of  retaining  walls,
      provided  that  a  report  by  the  architect  or  engineer is submitted
      substantiating the safety of the  proposed  construction  and  verifying
      that  an  "in-place" inspection has been made of the rock exposed and of
      the jointing therein in the excavation.
