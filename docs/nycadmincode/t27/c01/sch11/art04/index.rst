Section 27-675 ::    
        
     
        §  27-675  Classification  of  soil  materials.  For  purposes of this
      subchapter,  soil  materials  shall  be  classified  and  identified  in
      accordance  with  table  11-1.  In addition, the following supplementary
      definitions shall apply.
        (a) Rock.
        (1) HARD SOUND  ROCK.  Includes  crystalline  rocks  such  as  Fordham
      geniss,   Ravenswood   geniss,   Palisades  diabase,  Manhattan  schist.
      Charateristics are: The rock rings when struck with pick  or  bar;  does
      not disintegrate after exposure to air or water; breaks with sharp fresh
      fracture;  cracks  are  unweathered  and less than one-eighth inch wide,
      generally no closer than three feet apart; core recovery with  a  double
      tube,  diamond  core  barrel is generally eighty-five percent or greater
      for each five foot run.
        (2) MEDIUM HARD ROCK. Includes crystalline rocks of paragraph  one  of
      this  subdivision,  plus  Inwood  marble and serpentine. Characteristics
      are: all those listed in paragraph one of this subdivision, except  that
      cracks  may  be  one-quarter inch wide and slightly weathered, generally
      spaced no closer than two feet apart; core recovery with a double  tube,
      diamond  core barrel is generally fifty percent or greater for each five
      foot run.
        (3) INTERMEDIATE ROCK. Includes rocks of paragraphs  one  and  two  of
      this  subdivision,  plus  cemented  shales  and  sandstone of the Newark
      formation.  Characteristics are: the rock gives dull sound  when  struck
      with  pick or bar; does not disintegrate after exposure to air or water;
      broken pieces may show weathered  surfaces;  may  contain  fracture  and
      weathered  zones  up  to one inch wide spaced as close as one foot; core
      recovery  with  a  double  tube,  diamond  core  barrel   is   generally
      thirty-five per cent or greater for each five foot run.
        (4) SOFT ROCK. Includes rocks of paragraphs one, two and three of this
      subdivision in partially weathered condition, plus uncemented shales and
      sandstones.  Characteristics  are: rock may soften on exposure to air or
      water; may contain throughly weathered zones up to three inches wide but
      filled with stiff soil; core recovery with a double tube,  diamond  core
      barrel  is  less  than  thirty-five  percent for each five foot run, but
      standard penetration resistance in soil  sampling  is  more  than  fifty
      blows  per  foot. Where core recoveries are less than twenty percent and
      the material is to be used for bearing, a minimum three inches  diameter
      core  shall  be recovered and the material recovered shall be classified
      in accordance with table 11-1.
        (b) Special soil types.
        (1) FINE SAND. Soils of group SM, containing more than  fifty  percent
      (by weight) of particles passing a number sixty mesh sieve.
        (2)  HARDPAN.  Soils  of  groups  GM,  GC,  and SW, generally directly
      overlying rock, and which are sufficiently cemented to be  difficult  to
      remove by picking.
        (3) CLAY SOILS. Soils of each group SC, CL, and CH shall be classified
      according to consistency as hard, medium, or soft in accordance with the
      following:
        a.  Hard clay. A clay requiring picking for removal, a fresh sample of
      which cannot be molded by pressure of the fingers.
        b. Medium clay. A clay that can be removed by spading, a fresh  sample
      of which can be molded by a substantial pressure of the fingers.
        c.  Soft  clay.  A  clay,  a  fresh sample of which can be molded with
      slight pressure of the fingers.
        (4) SILT SOILS. Soils of each group ML and MH shall be  classified  as
      dense, medium, or loose depending on relative difficulties of removal as
      described  for  hard,  medium, and soft clays in paragraph three of this
      subdivision.
    
        (5) VARVED SILT. A natural soil deposit consisting of alternating thin
      layers of silt, clay, and sand in which  the  silt  or  silt  plus  sand
      layers predominate.

      FIELD INDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES FOR FINE-GRAINED SOILS OR FRACTIONS
     
        These  procedures  are  to be performed on the minus No. 40 sieve size
      particles, approximately 1/64 in.  For  field  classification  purposes,
      screening  is  not  intended, simply remove by hand the coarse particles
      that interfere with the tests.
     
        Dilatancy (reaction to shaking)
        After removing particles larger than No. 40 sieve size, prepare a  pat
          of moist soil with a volume of about one-half cubic inch. Add enough
          water if necessary to make the soil soft but not sticky.
        Place  the  pat  in  the open palm of one hand and shake horizontally,
      striking vigorously against the other hand  several  times.  A  positive
      reaction  consists  of the appearance of water on the surface of the pat
      which changes to a livery  consistency  and  becomes  glossy.  When  the
      sample  is  squeezed  between the fingers, the water and gloss disappear
      from the surface, the pat stiffens, and finally it cracks  or  crumbles.
      The   rapidity  of  appearance  of  water  during  shaking  and  of  its
      disappearance during squeezing assist in indentifying the  character  of
      the fines in a soil.
        Very  fine  clean  sands  give the quickest and most distinct reaction
      whereas a plastic clay has no  reaction.  Inorganic  silts,  such  as  a
      typical rock flour, show a moderately quick reaction.
     
        Dry Strength (crushing characteristics)
        After  removing particles larger than No. 40 sieve size, mold a pat of
          soil to the consistency of putty, adding water if  necessary.  Allow
          the pat to dry completely by oven, sun, or air-drying, and then test
          its  strength  by  breaking  and crumbling between the fingers. This
          strength is a measure of the character and quantity of the colloidal
          fraction contained in the soil.  The  dry  strength  increases  with
          increasing plasticity.
        High  dry  strength  is  characteristic  for  clays of the CH group. A
      typical inorganic silt possesses only very slight  dry  strength.  Silty
      fine sands and silts have about the same slight dry strength, but can be
      distinguished  by  the feel when powdering the dried specimen. Fine sand
      feels gritty whereas a typical silt has the smooth feel of flour.
    
        Toughness (consistency near plastic limit)
        After  particles  larger  than  the  No.  40 sieve size are removed, a
          specimen of soil about one-half inch cube in size, is molded to  the
          consistency of putty. If too dry, water must be added and if sticky,
          the  specimen  should  be  spread out in a thin layer and allowed to
          lose some moisture by evaporation. Then the specimen is  rolled  out
          by hand on a smooth surface or between the palms into a thread about
          one-eighth  inch in diameter. The thread is then folded and rerolled
          repeatedly.  During  this  manipulation  the  moisture  content   is
          gradually  reduced  and  the  specimen  stiffens,  finally loses its
          plasticity, and crumbles when the plastic limit is reached.
        After the thread crumbles, the pieces should be lumped together and  a
      slight kneading action continued until the lump crumbles.
        The tougher the thread near the plastic limit and the stiffer the lump
      when it finally crumbles, the more potent is the colloidal clay fraction
      in  the soil. Weakness of the thread at the plastic limit and quick loss
      of coherence of  the  lump  below  the  plastic  limit  indicate  either
      inorganic clay of low plasticity, or materials such as kaolin-type clays
      and organic clays which occur below the A-line.
        Highly  organic  clays have a very weak and spongy feel at the plastic
      limit.

Section 27-677 ::    
        
     
        §  27-677  Nominally  unsatisfactory  bearing material. Fill material,
      peat, (group Pt), organic silts and clays (grouping OL and OH), soft  or
      loose  soils  of  groups ML, CL, HM and CH, varved silt, or satisfactory
      bearing materials that contain lenses of, or  are  underlain  by,  these
      materials  shall  be  considered  as  nominally  unsatisfactory  bearing
      materials.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-678
--------------

Section 27-678 ::    
        
     
        §  27-678  Allowable  soil  bearing  pressures.  The allowable bearing
      pressures on satisfactory bearing materials shall be  those  established
      in   table   11-2.   The   allowable   bearing  pressures  on  nominally
      unsatisfactory  bearing  materials  shall  be   those   established   in
      accordance  with  section  27-679  of  this  article.  Allowable bearing
      pressure shall be considered to be the allowable pressure at a point  in
      the  soil  mass in excess of the stabilized overburden pressure existing
      at the same point  prior  to  construction  operations.  The  stabilized
      overburden pressure existing at a point shall be defined as that portion
      of  the  weight  of  the  overlying  soil  material that is supported by
      granular  interaction  rather  than  pore  pressure.  In  general,   the
      magnitude  of  the stabilized overburden pressure may be approximated as
      follows:
        (a) The overlying soil material  shall  have  been  in  place  for  an
      adequate  length  of time to produce a stable condition of pore pressure
      in, or below the foundation level. Where the bearing stratum consists of
      soils of classes  5-65  through  8-65,  the  bearing  stratum  shall  be
      considered  to be fully consolidated except with regard to the weight of
      that portion of the overlying soil material that consists of added  fill
      material.
        (b)  Where  all  or  a  portion of the overlying soil consists of fill
      material, the weight of the fill material shall not be included  in  the
      stabilized  overburden  pressure  unless  the  magnitude  of  stabilized
      pressure is verified by  an  architect  or  engineer  on  the  basis  of
      laboratory or field tests on undisturbed material.
        (c)  Where  the  bearing  stratum  consists  of  soils of classes 9-65
      through 11-65, the stabilized overburden pressure shall be considered as
      zero unless the magnitude of the stabilized pressure is  established  by
      an  architect  or  engineer on the basis of laboratory or field tests on
      undisturbed material.
        (d) The stabilized overburden pressure shall not include the weight of
      any soil removed by excavation and not replaced. For footings, the total
      stabilized overburden pressure shall not exceed  the  weight  of  a  one
      square  foot column of soil (considering submerged weight where the soil
      column is partly submerged) measured from the bottom of the  footing  to
      the  lowest  level  of  the  final  grade  above  the footing. For a box
      foundation, where the strength of the slab is adequate to stabilize  the
      underlying soil, the stabilized overburden pressure shall not exceed the
      weight  of  a one square foot column of soil measured from the bottom of
      the box to the lowest level of the adjacent grade.
        (e) Where the bearing  stratum  consists  of  soils  of  classes  9-65
      through  11-65, the allowable bearing pressure shall be adjusted for the
      effects of rebound due to excavation as  determined  from  consolidation
      test data.
        (f) Where the bearing stratum consists of rock of classes 1-65 through
      3-65, the stabilized overburden pressure shall be neglected.

      ========================================================================
     
      Notes:
        (1) Classification.  The  soil classifications indicated in this table
      are those described in section 27-675 of this article.  Where  there  is
      doubt  as  to  the  applicable  classification  of  a  soil stratum, the
      allowable bearing pressure applicable to the lower class of material  to
      which the given stratum might conform shall apply unless the conformance
      to  the  higher  class  of material can be proven by laboratory or field
      test procedures.
        (2) Allowable bearing pressure on rock. The tabulated values of  basic
      allowable  bearing  pressures  apply  only  for  massive  rocks  or, for
      sedimentary or foliated rocks, where the strata are level or nearly  so,
      and,  then only if the area has ample lateral support. Tilted strata and
      their relation to nearby slopes or  excavations  shall  receive  special
      consideration.
        (3) Allowable  bearing  pressure on hardpan. For hardpan consisting of
      well cemented material composed of a predominantly granular  matrix  and
      free of lenses of fine grained material and inclusions of soft rock, the
      basic  allowable  bearing pressure shall be twelve tons per square foot.
      For hardpan consisting of poorly cemented material or containing  lenses
      of  fine  grained  material,  inclusions of soft rock, or a fine grained
      matrix, the basic allowable bearing pressure shall  be  eight  tons  per
      square foot.
        (4) Allowable  bearing  pressure on gravel and gravel soils. Values of
      basic allowable bearing pressure shall be as follows:
          (a) For soils of Soil Groups GW, GP, GM, and GC:
            Compact, well graded material--ten tons per square foot.
            Loose, poorly graded material--six tons per square foot.
            Intermediate   conditions--Estimate   by   interpolation   between
            indicated extremes.
    
          (b) For  soils  of  Soil Groups SW, SP, and SM, containing more than
        ten percent of material retained on a No. 4 sieve:
            Compact, well graded material--eight tons per square foot.
            Loose, poorly graded material--four tons per square foot.
            Intermediate   conditions--Estimate   by   interpolation   between
            indicated extremes.
        (5) Allowable bearing pressure on sands. The basic  allowable  bearing
      pressure  shall  be determined from the resistance to penetration of the
      standard sampling spoon. The basic allowable bearing  pressure  in  tons
      per  square  foot shall equal 0.10 times N but not greater than six tons
      per square  foot,  nor  less  than  three  tons  per  square  foot.  The
      appropriate value for the penetration resistance at various areas of the
      site  shall  be made by averaging the measured resistance within a depth
      of soil below the proposed footing level  equal  to  the  width  of  the
      footing.  Where  the average values so obtained do not vary by more than
      twenty-five percent of the minimum of the average values over  the  site
      of the proposed building, the lowest average value shall be used for the
      design  of  the entire building. Where the variation exceeds twenty-five
      percent, the allowable bearing  pressure  shall  be  predicated  on  the
      lowest  average  value  unless  appropriate  measures are taken to avoid
      detrimental amounts of differential settlements of the  footings.  Where
      the  design  bearing  pressure on soils of class 7-65 exceeds three tons
      per square foot, the embedment of the loaded  area  below  the  adjacent
      grade  shall not be less than four feet and the width of the loaded area
      not less than three feet, unless analysis shall demonstrate the proposed
      construction to have a minimum factor of safety  of  2.0  against  shear
      failure of the soil.
        (6) Allowable  bearing  pressure  on  fine  sand.  The basic allowable
      bearing pressure shall be determined from the resistance to  penetration
      of  the standard sampling spoon. The basic allowable bearing pressure in
      tons per square foot shall equal 0.10 times N but not greater than  four
      tons  per  square  foot  nor  less than two tons per square foot, except
      that, for loose materials (resistance to  penetration  of  the  standard
      sampling  spoon  ten  blows  per  foot or less), where the foundation is
      subjected to vibratory  loads  from  machinery  or  similar  cause,  the
      indicated  basic  values shall not apply. The allowable bearing pressure
      shall be established by analysis applying accepted  principles  of  soil
      mechanics and a report of such analysis satisfactory to the commissioner
      shall  be  submitted  as a part of the application for the acceptance of
      the plans.
        (7) Allowable bearing pressure on clays and clay  soils.  The  bearing
      capacity of medium and hard clays and clay soils shall be established on
      the  basis  of  the  strength  of  such  soils as determined by field or
      laboratory tests and shall provide a factor of safety against failure of
      the soil of not less than 2.0 computed on  the  basis  of  a  recognized
      procedure  of soils analysis, shall consider probable settlements of the
      building, and shall not exceed the tabulated maximum values.
        (8) Increases in allowable bearing pressure due to  embedment  of  the
      foundation.  (a)  The basic allowable bearing values for rock of classes
      1-65, 2-65 and 3-65 shall apply where the loaded area is on the  surface
      of  sound rock. Where the loaded area is below the adjacent rock surface
      and is fully confined by the adjacent rock mass and  provided  that  the
      rock mass has not been shattered by blasting or otherwise is or has been
      rendered  unsound, these values may be increased ten percent of the base
      value for each foot of embedment below the surface of the adjacent  rock
      surface  in  excess  of  one  foot, but shall not exceed twice the basic
      values. (b) The basic allowable bearing values for soils of classes 5-65
      through 8-65 determined in accordance with notes three,  four  and  five
    
      above,  shall  apply where the loaded area is embedded four feet or less
      in the bearing stratum. Where the loaded area is embedded more than four
      feet below the adjacent surface of the bearing  stratum,  and  is  fully
      confined  by  the  weight  of  the  adjacent  soil,  these values may be
      increased five percent of the base value for  each  foot  of  additional
      embedment,  but  shall  not  exceed twice the basic values. Increases in
      allowable bearing pressure due to embedment shall not apply to soils  of
      classes 4-65, 9-65, 10-65, or 11-65.
        (9) Increase  in  allowable  bearing  pressure  for  limited  depth of
      bearing stratum: The allowable bearing values for soils of classes 6-65,
      7-65 and 8-65 determined in accordance with this  table  and  the  notes
      thereto  (including  note eight), may be increased up to one-third where
      the density of the bearing stratum below the bottom of the  footings  or
      the  tips  of  the  piles  increases  with  depth provided that: (a) The
      bearing stratum is not underlain by materials of a lower class.  (b) The
      allowable bearing value of the soil material underlying  the  bottom  of
      the  footings  or the tips of the piles increases at least fifty percent
      within a depth below the footing or the tips of the piles which  is  not
      greater  than  the  width  of  the  footing  or the width of the polygon
      circumscribing the pile group.   (c)  It  shall  be  demonstrated  by  a
      recognized  means  of  analysis  that  the  probable  settlement  of the
      foundation due  to  compression,  and/or  consolidation  do  not  exceed
      acceptable limits for the proposed building.
        (10) Combination of loads. The provisions of section 27-594 of article
      two of subchapter ten of this chapter shall apply.
        (11) Correction  for  foundations  bearing  on  materials  of  varying
      bearing capacities. Where it is  shown  by  borings  or  otherwise  that
      materials  of  varying  bearing  value  will  be  used  for support of a
      building: (1) Where the weakest material does not rank below class 5-65,
      no modifications shall be required.   (2) Where  the  weakest  materials
      rank  as classes 6-65 through 8-65, if the difference in basic allowable
      bearing values for the several materials does not exceed thirty  percent
      of  the allowable value for the poorest material which is to support the
      foundation, the foundations may be proportioned  in  direct  conformance
      with  the  allowable  bearing  pressures.  Where the difference in basic
      allowable bearing values exceeds thirty  percent,  appropriate  measures
      shall  be  taken  to limit the differential settlements of the different
      portions of the structure to tolerable  values.  (3)  For  materials  of
      classes  9-65  and  10-65,  in  all cases, appropriate measures shall be
      taken to equalize the settlements  of  the  different  portions  of  the
      structure.
        (12) Inundated  footings.  The  provisions of this section relating to
      materials  of  classes  1-65  through  7-65,  shall  be  deemed  equally
      applicable  both  to  the dry and to the inundated condition of the soil
      provided: (a) That the  subgrade  is  undisturbed  by  the  construction
      operations,  (b)  The  bearing area is in a confined condition. For such
      cases, no reduction in allowable bearing value will  be  required  where
      the  soil  supporting  the  foundation  is  subject to a rising level of
      inundation. However, the effects on settlement of  a  falling  level  of
      inundation  occurring  after  construction  of  the  foundation shall be
      considered in the design.

Section 27-679 ::    
        
     
        §   27-679   Bearing  capacity  of  nominally  unsatisfactory  bearing
      materials.    Whenever  soils  exploration  shows  that   the   proposed
      foundation  would  rest on, or be underlain by, nominally unsatisfactory
      bearing materials, a report based on soil tests and foundation  analysis
      (including  analysis  of  undisturbed  samples) shall be submitted by an
      architect or engineer, demonstrating, subject to  the  approval  of  the
      commissioner,  that  the proposed construction, under a condition of one
      hundred  percent  over  load,  is  safe  against  failure  of  the  soil
      materials.
        The  report  shall  also  show  that  the probable total magnitude and
      distribution of settlement to be expected under design  conditions  will
      not  result  in instability of the building or stresses in the structure
      in excess of the allowable values established in subchapter ten of  this
      chapter. In addition, the following provisions shall apply:
        (a) Fill materials.
        (1)  CONTROLLED  FILLS.  Fills  shall  be  considered  as satisfactory
      bearing materials of class 6-65 or 7-65 when placed in  accordance  with
      the   following   procedures,   under   the  provisions  for  controlled
      inspection.
        a. Before placement of fill, the  existing  ground  surface  shall  be
      stripped  of  all  organic  growth,  timber,  rubbish, and debris. After
      stripping, the ground surface shall  be  compacted  to  the  density  in
      subparagraph d of this paragraph.
        b.  Materials  for  fill shall consist of sand, gravel, crushed stone,
      crushed gravel, or a mixture of these,  and  shall  contain  no  organic
      matter.  The  fill  materials  shall contain no particles exceeding four
      inches in the largest dimension. No more than thirty  per  cent  of  the
      material  shall  be retained on a three-quarter inch sieve. The material
      passing the three quarter inch sieve shall contain, by weight,  no  more
      than  forty  percent  passing  the  one hundred sieve, or twelve percent
      passing the two hundred sieve.
        c. The grading of the fill shall be determined in accordance with  the
      applicable procedures of reference standards RS 11-1 and RS 11-2.
        d. Fill shall be placed and compacted at its optimum moisture content,
      in  uniform  layers not more than twelve inches thick (after compaction)
      and each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to a density not less  than
      ninety-five  percent  of the density prescribed in reference standard RS
      11-3. The field density shall be verified by in-place density tests made
      on each lift of the embankment. Fill shall not be placed when frozen  or
      placed on a frozen or wet sub-grade.
        (2) UNCONTROLLED FILLS. Fill material, other than controlled fill, may
      be  used  for  the  support of buildings, other than one- and two-family
      dwellings, and may be considered as  satisfactory  bearing  material  of
      applicable class, subject to the following:
        a.  The  soil  within  the  building area shall be explored using test
      pits.  At least one test pit, penetrating at least eight feet below  the
      level  of  the  bottom  of  the proposed footings, shall be provided for
      every twenty-five hundred square feet of building area. Where such  test
      pits consistently indicate that the fill is composed of material that is
      free of voids and free of extensive inclusions of mud, organic materials
      such  as  paper,  garbage,  cans,  or  metallic objects, and debris, the
      provisions of subparagraphs b and c of this paragraph shall apply. Where
      the test pits show such voids or inclusions, the  additional  provisions
      of  subparagraph d of this paragraph shall apply. Borings may be used in
      lieu of test pits, provided that continuous samples at least four inches
      in diameter are recovered.
        b. The building area shall be additionally explored using one standard
      boring under each column. These borings shall  be  carried  to  a  depth
    
      sufficient  to  penetrate  into natural ground, but not less than twenty
      feet below grade, and a sufficient number shall  penetrate  deeper  than
      twenty  feet  as  required  to  meet the provisions of section 27-663 of
      article  two  of  this  subchapter.  Where  such  borings  show voids or
      inclusions, the provisions of subparagraph d  of  this  paragraph  shall
      apply.
        c.  The allowable soil bearing pressure on the fill material shall not
      exceed two tons per square foot.
        d. Wherever the  fill  shows  voids  or  inclusions  as  described  in
      subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph either the fill shall be treated
      as  having  no  presumptive  bearing  capacity,  or  the  building shall
      incorporate adequate strength and stiffness  to  bridge  such  voids  or
      inclusions or shall be articulated to prevent damage due to differential
      or localized settlement of the fill.
        (b) Organic silts, organic clays, soft inorganic clay, loose inorganic
      silt, and varved silt.
        (1)  The  allowable bearing pressure shall be determined independently
      of table 11-2 subject to the following:
        a. For varved  silts,  the  soil  bearing  pressure  produced  by  the
      proposed building shall not exceed two tons per square foot, except that
      for  desiccated  or preconsolidated soils, higher bearing pressures will
      be allowed.
        b. For organic silts or clays (groups OL and OH) or for soft or  loose
      soils  of  groups ML, CL, MH, and CH, the soil bearing pressure produced
      by the proposed building shall not exceed one ton per square foot except
      that a value of two tons per square foot will be permitted on soils that
      are adequately preconsolidated or artificially treated.
        (2) The report required in this section shall contain, as  a  minimum,
      the following information:
        a. Geological profiles through the area defining the stratigraphy.
        b.  Sufficient  laboratory  test  data on the compressible material to
      indicate   the   coefficient   of    consolidation,    coefficient    of
      compressibility,  permeability,  secondary  compression characteristics,
      and Atterberg limits.
        c. Where the design contemplates improvement of  the  natural  bearing
      capacity  and/or reduction in settlements by virtue of preloading, cross
      sections showing the amount of fill and surcharge to be placed on design
      details showing the required time for surcharging  shall  be  indicated,
      and  computations showing the amount of settlement to be expected during
      surcharging. Records of settlement plate elevations  and  pore  pressure
      readings, before, during, and after surcharging, shall be filed with the
      commissioner.
        d. The estimated amount and rate of settlement expected to occur after
      the  structure  has  been completed, including the influence of dead and
      live loads of the structure.
        e. A detailed analysis showing that the anticipated future  settlement
      will not adversely affect the performance of the structure.
        f.  Where  sand  drains  are  to  be  used,  computations  showing the
      diameter, spacing, and method of installation of such drains,  shall  be
      provided.
        (c)   Artificially   treated   soils.  Nominally  unsatisfactory  soil
      materials that are artificially compacted, cemented, or  preconsolidated
      (including soils compacted by vibration, cemented by chemical injection,
      or  preconsolidated  by use of electric current, but not including cases
      where preconsolidation consists solely of the use of surcharge  with  or
      without  sand  drains)  may  be  used  for the support of buildings, and
      nominally satisfactory soil materials that are similarly treated may  be
    
      used  to  resist  soil bearing pressures in excess of those indicated in
      table 11-2 for the soil in its natural state, subject to the following:
        (1)  The  vertical  and  lateral extent of the soil that is compacted,
      cemented, or preconsolidated shall conform to the  full  extent  of  the
      distribution  of  loading  that is assumed for purposes of computing the
      intensities of the  soil  bearing  pressure.  The  actual  soil  bearing
      pressure shall not exceed the limitations of subdivisions (a) and (b) of
      this  section  for  nominally  unsatisfactory  bearing materials or, for
      satisfactory bearing materials, shall  not  exceed  the  limitations  of
      table 11-2.
        (2)  After  the  treatment procedure, a minimum of one boring shall be
      made for every sixteen hundred  square  feet  of  that  portion  of  the
      building area that is supported on treated soil, and a sufficient number
      of  samples  shall be recovered from the treated soil to demonstrate the
      efficacy of the treatment.

        §  27-680 Utility services. Where utility service lines are to be laid
      in soil materials of class 11-65, provision shall  be  made  to  prevent
      damage to such service lines as follows:
        (a)  Where  the  lines  enter  a  structure,  including  a building, a
      manhole, or a junction chamber, that is rigidly supported on piles or in
      firm bearing material, the services  shall  be  supported  on  piles  or
      bearing   materials   of   adequate  firmness  to  prevent  differential
      settlement  of  the  service  lines  with  respect  to  the   structure;
      otherwise,  provisions, such as oversized sleeves, flexible connections,
      utility tunnels, or other approved device, shall be made to  permit  the
      anticipated differential movement to occur without damage to the service
      lines.
        (b)  Where  the  lines  enter  a  structure  that is supported on soil
      materials of class 11-65 or on soft clay or  loose  silt  deposits,  and
      engineering   analysis  shall  be  made  of  the  probable  differential
      settlement of the utility service line with respect  to  the  structure,
      and  provision  shall  be  made  to  accommodate  such  displacement, as
      described in subdivision (a) of this section.
