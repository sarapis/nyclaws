Section 27-963 ::    
        
     
        §  27-963  Direct connection of sprinklers to the public water system.
      Direct connection of sprinklers to a city water main shall be acceptable
      as  an  automatic  water  supply,  provided  the  main  is  capable   of
      maintaining  a  pressure  of  at  least  fifteen  psig at the top of the
      highest sprinkler riser, with five hundred gpm of water flowing  from  a
      two  and one-half inch hydrant outlet located at the street level within
      two hundred fifty feet of the building. The hydrant test shall  be  made
      between  the  hours of eight a.m. and five p.m. on a working day. If the
      pressure found in this test is insufficient to  comply  with  the  above
      requirement,  a  minimum  of  twelve  psig  at  the  top  of the highest
      sprinkler riser shall be acceptable, provided that  all  piping  in  the
      affected area and supply piping thereto that is four inches and under is
      increased one pipe size above those sizes required by reference standard
      RS 17-2, RS 17-2A or RS 17-2B, as applicable. In addition to the fifteen
      psig  or  twelve  psig requirements, the following requirements shall be
      met.
        (a) The size of each connection shall be as large as that of the  main
      riser  and,  except in sprinkler systems in multiple dwellings, shall be
      at least three inches and shall be controlled by an  accessible  shutoff
      valve.
        (b) The service pipe shall be flushed out thoroughly before connecting
      to  the  sprinkler system. A flow sufficient to produce a water velocity
      of at least five fps shall be used.
        (c) Each service shall be equipped, under the sidewalk, with a control
      valve in a flush sidewalk box located within two feet of the front  wall
      of  the  building  or  street  line  as  required  by  the department of
      environmental protection. The location of the  control  valve  shall  be
      indicated  by  a  sign  placed  on  the  structure directly opposite the
      sidewalk flush box, and such sign shall have a white background with one
      inch red letters  reading:  "Automatic  Sprinkler  Shutoff  Valve...Feet
      Opposite  This  Sign." Alternatively, brass, bronze, or other metal sign
      with one inch letters, raised or counter-sunk one-eighth of an inch  may
      be used.
        (d)  The  plans  submitted  in  connection with the permit application
      shall be accompanied by a statement from the bureau of water  supply  of
      the  department  of environmental protection, stating the size of street
      main or mains, distance to and size of mains from which it or  they  are
      fed,  the location of control valves, the static pressure on the hydrant
      nearest the premises, and the residual pressure in the street main taken
      on a hydrant near the premises when the flow from the nearest hydrant is
      equal to the flow required to meet the requirements of this  section.  A
      letter   from   the   bureau  of  water  supply  of  the  department  of
      environmental protection estimating available flow and residual pressure
      shall be acceptable to the borough superintendent when  a  hydrant  test
      cannot be conducted.

Section 27-964 ::    
        
     
        §  27-964  Sprinkler  booster  pumps. Where the pressure from the city
      water main is insufficient to comply with the  requirements  of  section
      27-963  of  this article but is sufficient to give at least five psig at
      the highest line of sprinklers as  determined  by  test,  an  automatic,
      electrically  driven  pump  installed  for  the  purpose  of boosting or
      increasing the city water  pressure  in  the  sprinkler  system  may  be
      accepted subject to the following requirements:
        (a) Pumps shall be of approved centrifugal type, capable of delivering
      at  least two hundred gpm, and shall be capable of supplying twenty-five
      per cent of the heads, in the largest area supplied, at twenty gpm, at a
      pressure of at  least  twenty-five  psig  at  the  top  of  the  highest
      sprinkler riser.
        (b)  Pumps  shall  be maintained under approved automatic control with
      closed circuit supervisory attachment. The supervisory attachments shall
      be directly connected to an office where maintenance  personnel  are  in
      attendance twenty-four hours a day; or, in lieu thereof, the supervisory
      attachment  may  be  directly  connected  to  the  central station of an
      approved operating fire alarm company. The  supervisory  alarm  services
      shall  be  arranged  so as to provide positive indication at an approved
      central office or sprinkler alarm panel board that the pump has operated
      or that the source of electrical supply has failed.
        (c) Such pumps shall also comply with  the  applicable  provisions  of
      sections  27-946  and 27-947 of article three of this subchapter, except
      that only one supply  shall  be  required  and  no  enclosure  shall  be
      required.

      system filled with a nonfreezing, noncombustible solution shall be used,
      and  when  a  system  filled  with  nonfreezing solution is used and the
      system is connected to a potable water supply, it shall  be  subject  to
      the requirements of the health department and the bureau of water supply
      of the department of environmental protection.
        (b) Sprinkler heads subject to damage shall be protected in accordance

Section 27-967 ::    
        
     
        §  27-967 Inspection and tests. All inspections and tests of sprinkler
      systems  shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
      subdivisions  a  through  f  of  section 27-951 of article three of this
      subchapter and the requirements of this article.
        (a) Automatic wet and dry systems. Automatic  wet  and  dry  sprinkler
      systems  shall  be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test for a period
      of one hour at a pressure of at least one hundred psig  at  the  topmost
      sprinkler  head  and  at  least  two  hundred  psig  at the lowest cross
      connection to the siamese connections.
        (b) Automatic dry pipe systems. In addition to the hydrostatic test in
      subdivision (a) of this section, the automatic dry  pipe  systems  shall
      also  be tested to forty psig air pressure for a twenty-four hour period
      with the pressure loss not to exceed one and one-half psig.
        (c) Nonautomatic sprinkler  systems.  Nonautomatic  sprinkler  systems
      shall  be  subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test of fifty psig at the
      topmost sprinkler head, with the test pressure maintained for  a  period
      of at least one hour.
        (d)  Pressure tanks. Pressure tanks shall be hydrostatically tested to
      a pressure of at least one and one-half times the working pressure for a
      period of one hour.
        (e)  Sprinkler  branches  and  heads  supplied  from  domestic  water.
      Sprinkler branches and heads shall be tested at the pressure required by
      this section or at the pressure of the domestic water supply as required
      by subchapter sixteen of this chapter, whichever is greater.
        (f)  System performance. A performance or operation test shall be made
      on  each  completed  system  to  determine  that  all  alarms,   valves,
      indicators,   pumps,   deluge   valves,   dry  pipe  valves,  and  other
      appurtenances are in good working order.
        (g) Supervisory service. All components connected to a central station
      of an approved operating fire alarm company shall be tested to determine
      that  they  are  in  good  working  order.  The  test  report  shall  be
      accompanied  by  a statement from the central supervisory agency stating
      that the agency has been retained to provide the  required  supervision;
      and when the services of the agency have been terminated it shall notify
      the commissioner in writing.
        (h)  Altered systems. When additions, alterations, or repairs are made
      to a sprinkler system, the entire system shall be tested  as  stated  in
      subdivisions  (a),  (b),  (c), (e), and (g) of this section, except that
      the pressure at the top of the system need not exceed one hundred  psig.
      In  addition,  a  flow  test of at least twenty gpm shall be made from a
