Section 27-598 ::    
        
     
        §  27-598  Core  tests  of  concrete construction. The adequacy of the
      concrete in a building may be ascertained by the recovery and testing of
      cores. Cores shall be taken and tested in accordance with the  procedure
      described  in  reference  standard  RS  10-16.  In  lieu  thereof, cores
      cast-in-place and originally cured with the parent  concrete,  or  other
      device acceptable to the architect or engineer designated for controlled
      inspection   and  which  will  produce  test  specimens  simulating  the
      condition of the concrete in place including the  size  and  proportions
      specified for core specimens may be utilized to demonstrate the adequacy
      of  the  concrete in place. The compressive strength so determined shall
      meet the requirements for  strength  tests  as  described  in  reference
      standard RS 10-3.
