        § 27-633 Analysis. (1) Unless otherwise permitted by the commissioner,
      stresses,  displacements,  and  stability of thin shell and folded-plate
      structures shall be determined on the basis of the assumption of elastic
      behavior. The shell or plate  may  be  assumed  to  be  homogeneous  and
      isotropic.
        (2) The analysis for stability shall consider large deflections, creep
      effects  and  the  deviation  between  the  actual and theoretical shell
      surface.
