Section 27-242 ::    
        
     
        §  27-242  Multiple occupancy or use. When a building or space is used
      for multiple  purposes,  involving  different  activities  at  different
      times,  the  building or space shall be given a separate occupancy group
      classification for each of  the  activities  involved.  The  design  and
      construction  of  the  building or space shall be in accordance with the
      most restrictive provisions of this  code  that  apply  to  any  of  the
      occupancy  group classifications utilized. However, a minor variation of
      any occupancy or use  of  a  space  from  technical  compliance  with  a
      particular  space  occupancy  classification  shall not be prohibited if
      such variation is normally associated with the occupancy  classification
      and no specific danger or hazard is created.
