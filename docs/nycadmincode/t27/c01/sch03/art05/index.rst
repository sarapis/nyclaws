--------------

Section 27-248 ::    
        
     
        §  27-248  Classification. Buildings and spaces shall be classified in
      the mercantile occupancy group when they are used for display and  sales
      of   goods  accessible  to  public  inspection.  Highly  combustible  or
      flammable goods, such as those made  of  pyroxylin  products,  shall  be
      limited to small quantities that do not constitute a high hazard; if not
      so  limited,  the  occupancy shall meet the requirements for high hazard
      occupancies when the latter are more restrictive than the  corresponding
      requirements for the mercantile classification.
