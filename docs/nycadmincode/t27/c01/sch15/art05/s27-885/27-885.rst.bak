        §  27-885  Labeling  gas  vents.  Gas  vents  for  use  with gas-fired
      equipment, and which are not designed  for  use  with  solid  or  liquid
      fuel-fired  equipment,  shall be plainly and permanently identified by a
      metal label etched or embossed to read: "This gas vent is for  equipment
      which  burns  gas only. Do not connect to incinerator or solid or liquid
      fuel-burning equipment." This label shall be attached to the vent  at  a
      point  near  where  the  gas  vent  system  enters the wall, ceiling, or
      chimney.
