      least  one  of  the  subdividing  fire  separations shall be of two-hour
      fire-resistive  construction  where  the  floor  area  exceeds   fifteen
      thousand  square  feet,  creating areas of refuge in the same manner and
      under the same conditions as provided in two of  this  subdivision.  The
      activation  of any such detectors shall have the same effect as provided
      in subdivision (f) of section  27-972  of  article  five  of  subchapter
      seventeen of this code.
        (4)  In  existing  buildings,  existing  fire  separations of one-hour
      fire-resistive  construction  may  be  accepted  in  lieu  of  the  fire
      separation  of  two hour fire-resistive construction providing all other
      requirements of  paragraphs  two  and  three  of  this  subdivision  are
      complied with.
        (5)  Regardless  of  the  floor area, no subdivision of the floor area
      shall  be  required  under  this  subdivision  when  complete  sprinkler
      protection is provided in accordance with the construction provisions of
      subchapter seventeen of this chapter.
        (6) Existing office buildings one hundred feet or more in height shall
      comply with the requirements of this subdivision as follows:
        a.  Whenever  an  alteration is performed involving partition changes,
      compliance with this subdivision shall be required in  that  portion  of
      the building being altered.
        b.  At  least one-third of the total floor area of the building not in
      compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision  on  February
      seventh,   nineteen   hundred  seventy-three,  shall  comply  with  such
      requirements  on  or  before  December  thirteenth,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-one.  Complete plans showing such compliance for the phase of the
      work to be done shall be filed with, and  a  permit  secured  from,  the
      commissioner on or before September thirteenth, nineteen hundred eighty.
        c.  At least two-thirds of the total floor area of the building not in
      compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision  on  February
      seventh,   nineteen   hundred  seventy-three,  shall  comply  with  such
      requirements on or before August seventh, nineteen hundred eighty-four.
    
        d. Full compliance shall be provided on or  before  February  seventh,
      nineteen hundred eighty-eight.
        (7)  In  existing  office buildings one hundred feet or more in height

Section 27-340 ::    
        
     
        §  27-340  Fire  divisions.  Fire  divisions  shall  be constructed of
      non-combustible materials or assembly  of  noncombustible  materials  to
      provide the fire-resistance ratings required by table 5-2. Vertical fire
      divisions  shall  be  continuous between foundation, roof, or horizontal
      fire divisions, and  through  any  concealed  space  in  floor  or  roof
      construction.  Horizontal  fire  divisions  shall  be continuous between
      exterior walls and/or vertical fire divisions.
        (a) When roof construction is combustible on both sides of a  vertical
      fire  division, the vertical fire division shall extend through the roof
      construction to a height of at least four inches above the high point at
      the roof framing. Decking shall tightly butt the  fire  division.  Above
      the  decking  of  roofs  that  are  flatter  than  twenty degrees to the
      horizontal, blocking shall be constructed to form cants on both sides of
      the fire division with slopes not steeper than 1:4. Combustible  decking
      shall not extend over the top of the fire division.
        (b)  Except  as required in subdivision (c) of this section, when roof
      construction is noncombustible on one or both sides of a  vertical  fire
      division,  the  vertical fire division may terminate at the underside of
      the noncombustible roof construction provided the junction of  the  wall
      and roof construction is made smoke tight.
        (c)  When  a vertical fire division is required by table 5-2 to have a
      fire-resistance rating of three or four hours, and the roof construction
      has a fire-resistance rating of less than two hours, the  fire  division
      shall  extend  above  the  roof  construction to form a parapet at least
      three feet high.
        (d) Fire divisions  shall  be  so  constructed  that  the  removal  or
      collapse  of  construction  on one side will not endanger the support of
      construction on the other side.
        (e) Fire divisions shall be made smoketight  at  their  junction  with
      exterior  walls.  In  buildings  of  construction  class  II-D and II-E,
      exterior walls shall be constructed of noncombustible  materials  for  a
      distance  of at least eighteen inches on each side of the fire division,
      or the fire division shall project at least twelve  inches  through  the
      exterior wall.
        (f)  Fire  divisions  may  be  offset  if the construction between the
      offset  divisions,  including  their   supports,   has   at   the   same
      fire-resistance  rating  as  the  fire  division, with all hollow spaces
      within the construction firestopped with noncombustible material.
        (g) Where combustible members such as joists, beams, or  girders  bear
      on,  or  frame  into,  vertical  fire  divisions, such members shall not
      extend through the wall and shall have at least  four  inches  of  solid
      noncombustible  material  below,  at  the sides, and at the ends of each
      such member.
        (h) Chases or recesses shall not be cut into fire divisions so  as  to
      reduce  their  thickness  below  that  required  for the fire-resistance
      rating.
        (i) Vertical fire divisions that are hollow shall be firestopped  with
      at least four inches of noncombustible material so as to prevent passage
      of  flame,  smoke,  or  hot gases through the hollow spaces to the story
      above or below, or to hollow spaces  within  connecting  floor  or  roof
      construction.

      materials or assembly of materials having at least  the  fire-resistance
      ratings required by table 5-1.
        (a)  Different tenancies. Different tenant apartments, suites, stores,
      offices, or other spaces that are not separated from each other by  fire
      divisions, shall be separated from each other by fire separations having
      at  least  the fire-resistance rating prescribed in table 5-1, but in no
      case less than one hour, and shall continue through any concealed spaces
      of the floor or roof construction above.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 27-342
--------------

Section 27-342 ::    
        
     
        §  27-342 Openings in fire divisions and separations. Openings in fire
      divisions  and  fire  separations  that   are   required   to   have   a
      fire-resistance rating, shall be protected by opening protectives having
      the  fire-resistance  ratings  prescribed in table 5-3, shall not exceed
      the limits in size and area herein prescribed, and shall comply with the
      provisions of section 27-329 of article three of this subchapter.   Door
      and  other  openings  in enclosures of vertical exits, exit passageways,
      corridors,  and  places  of  assembly  shall  be  protected  by  opening
      protectives  as  required by the provisions of subchapters six and eight
      of this chapter.  When such enclosures also serve as fire  divisions  or
      fire separations, openings therein shall be protected as required by the
      provisions of this subchapter.
        (a)  Size of opening. In buildings that are not sprinklered no opening
      through a fire division or fire  separation  shall  exceed  one  hundred
      twenty  square feet in area, with no dimension greater than twelve feet,
      and the aggregate width of all openings at any level  shall  not  exceed
      twenty-five  percent of the length of the wall.  Where the areas on both
      sides  of  a  fire  division  or  fire  separation  are  sprinklered  in
      accordance  with  the construction provisions of subchapter seventeen of
      this chapter, the size of the opening may be one  hundred  fifty  square
      feet in area, with no dimension greater than fifteen feet.  In buildings
      fully  sprinklered  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of subchapter
      seventeen of ths chapter, the  size  and  aggregate  width  of  openings
      through  fire  divisions or fire separations shall be unlimited.  When a
      fire division or fire separation serves as a horizontal  exit  also,  it
      shall  have  no opening other than door openings not exceeding fifty-six
      square feet in area, the aggregate width of all openings  at  any  level
      shall  not  exceed  twenty-five  percent  of the length of the wall, and
      shall comply with the provisions of section 27-373 of  article  five  of
      subchapter six of this chapter.
        (b)  Conveyor  openings.  Where fire doors or shutters are impractical
      for the protection of  conveyor  openings  in  fire  divisions  or  fire
      separations, a system of water spray nozzles may be used.  At least four
      nozzles  shall  be  provided  on  each side of the opening so as to give
      complete coverage of the opening.   Nozzles shall be  controlled  by  an
      automatic  valve  actuated by a heat detector.  Nozzles shall be located
      at an angle not more than  thirty  degrees  between  the  centerline  of
      nozzle  discharge  and a line perpendicular to the plane of the opening.
      The water discharge rate shall be at least three gallons per square foot
      per minute.  When conveyor openings through floors are protected by this
      method, the openings shall also  be  provided  with    a  noncombustible
      enclosure  constructed  around  the  conveyor  from  the  floor up to or
      slightly beyond the spray nozzles, and draft curtains shall be  provided
      extending twenty-four inches below and around the floor opening.

      openings in the wall within a distance of thirty feet  vertically  above
      the  vent opening, and within five feet either side of the vent opening.
      When a side of a shaft is an exterior wall or a wall of a roof bulkhead,
      the  required  vent  may  be  a  louver  or window. Any window or louver
      located in  a  shaft  wall  above  a  roof  constructed  of  combustible
      materials shall have its sill at least thirty-six inches above the roof.
        (e)  Terminus  of  shaft  vents.  Of  the total required vent area for
      shafts, at least one-third shall  be  clear  opening  to  the  outdoors,
      either  in  the  form  of  fixed  louvers,  ridge  vents,  or  hooded or
      goosenecked openings.  In lieu thereof, skylights or trap doors  may  be
      used  if  constructed and arranged to open automatically by fusible link
      or other mechanical device  when  subjected  to  a  temperature  of  one
      hundred  sixty degrees Fahrenheit or to a rapid rise in temperature at a
      rate of fifteen to twenty degrees Fahrenheit per minute.  The  remaining
      portion  of  the  required  vent area may be a window or skylight glazed
      with plain glass not more than one-eighth inch  thick  or  slow  burning
      plastic.
        (f)   Machine   rooms.   Any  compartment  containing  machinery  that

Section 27-348
--------------

Section 27-348 ::    
        
     
        §  27-348  Interior  finish.  (a) Definition. For the purposes of this
      section, interior finish  shall  mean  those  materials  that  form  the
      exposed  interior surfaces of a building and that are part of or affixed
      to walls, fixed or folding partitions, ceilings, and other  construction
      elements.
        (b)  Classification.  Interior finish materials shall be classified in
      accordance with the surface flame-spread rating obtained  as  prescribed
      in the provisions of reference standard RS 5-5. Where an interior finish
      material is comprised of two or more materials laminated, glued, nailed,
      or otherwise secured together, the test rating for flame spread shall be
      based  upon  the composite of the materials in the form in which it will
      be used in construction. Interior finish materials shall be  grouped  in
      the  following  classes,  in  accordance with their surface flame spread
      characteristics:
     
                Interior Finish Class         Flame-Spread Rating
                          A                         0 to  25
                          B                        26 to  75
                          C                        76 to 225
                          D                        Over  225
     
        (c)  Requirements.  Interior  finishes  and  exposed   structural   or
      construction materials shall have a flame-spread rating not greater than
      that designated by the class prescribed for the various occupancy groups
      in  which  they  are  used,  as listed in table 5-4. Exceptions to these
      requirements are:
        (1) Finish flooring and floor coverings,  which  are  subject  to  the
      requrements of section 27-351.
        (2)  Wall  coverings  and  coatings  that are less than 0.036 in total
      thickness, when applied directly to a noncombustible, or  fire-retardant
      treated wood, substrate.
        (3) Exposed structural members and planking in buildings of class II-A
      construction,  which may be left exposed in any room or space, except in
      exits.
        (4) Twenty per cent (20%) of the aggregate wall and  ceiling  area  of
      any  room, space, or corridor required to have a class A or B rating may
      be finished with materials having a class C rating. This allowance shall
      include  the  area  of  doors,  folding  partitions,  windows,  glazing,
      skylights,   luminous   ceilings,  trim,  bases,  chair  rails,  panels,
      moldings, etc. This exception shall not operate as  a  waiver  of  other
      requirements of this code relating to opening protectives.
        (5)  When  a sprinkler system is provided in any room or space, and is
      installed in compliance with the construction provisions  of  subchapter
      seventeen  of  this  chapter, interior finish materials may be one class
      higher in flame-spread rating than required by tables 5-4.
        (d) Smoke density. No material shall be used for  interior  finish  in
      the  following  locations  if  the  material  develops  smoke in greater
      density than the rating shown, based upon a test conducted in accordance
      with the provisions of reference standard RS  5-5.  Materials  used  for
      interior finish that cover not more than twenty percent of the aggregate
      wall  and  ceiling  area of any room, space, or corridor shall be exempt
      from the above requirements.

        (e) Toxicity. No material shall be used in any interior location that,
      upon  exposure  to  fire  will  produce  products  of  decomposition  or
      combustion that are more toxic in  point  of  concentration  than  those
      given  off by wood or paper when decomposing or burning under comparable
      conditions.
        (f) Attachment of interior finish.
        (1) To be credited with the same  rating,  interior  finish  materials
      that  were  applied  to  a substrate when tested shall be applied at the
      building to an equivalent substrate.
        (2) Interior finish materials shall be cemented or  otherwise  secured
      in  place in the same manner and with materials equivalent to those used
      in flame-spread tests conducted in accordance with  subdivision  (b)  of
      this section for the applicable classification.
        (3)  Where walls, ceilings, partitions, or other construction elements
      are required to have a fire-resistance rating  or  are  required  to  be
      constructed  of  noncombustible  materials,  and  the interior finish is
      secured to studs or furring, the surface of the interior  finish  facing
      the concealed space shall either have a class A rating, shall be applied
      to  a  substrate  that has a class A rating, or shall have the concealed
      space completely filled with noncombustible material.

                                 NOTES FOR TABLE 5-4
        a. In determining the applicable requirements for  rooms  or  enclosed
      spaces, the occupancy group classification of the room or enclosed space
      shall  be  the  governing  factor,  regardless  of  the  occupancy group
      classification of the building. For the purposes of this table, the area
      of  a  room  shall  be  that  floor  area  contained  within   enclosing
      construction   in  which  interior  doors  or  other  interior  openings
      represent not more than  ten  percent  of  the  area  of  the  enclosing
    
      construction.   Interior  doors  or  windows  that  are  constructed  of
      noncombustible materials and that are self-closing or automatic  may  be
      ignored  in  computing  door  or opening area. Rooms or spaces that have
      unprotected  openings  constituting more than ten percent of the area of
      enclosing construction shall not  be  considered  as  a  room.  Interior
      finish  requirements  for  rooms  are based upon rooms being enclosed in
      ceiling high partitions. Partitions,  to  be  considered  ceiling  high,
      shall  extend up to the floor or roof construction above or to a ceiling
      having at least a three-quarter hour fire-resistance rating.  Partitions
      that  do  not  comply  with  this requirement shall not be considered as
      enclosing the spaces, and the rooms or  spaces  on  both  sides  thereof
      shall be considered as one.
        b.  Rooms  or spaces through which it is necessary for occupants of an
      adjacent room to pass in order to reach the only  exit  shall,  for  the
      purposes  of  this  table,  be  considered  as  corridors. Where used in
      corridors, class B finish material shall not extend more than fifty feet
      between separations of class A finish material that  are  at  least  two
      feet wide.
        c.  On  the  street floor of one-story buildings in construction group
      II, ceilings, beams, trusses, etc. that  are  twenty  feet  or  more  in
      height from the floor to their lowest part, may have a class C finish.
        d.  Class  C  interior  finish  may  be  used in offices, or groups of
      offices, whose use is accessory to an occupancy, provided  such  offices
      are  separated from the occupancy, by construction having at least a two
      hour fire-resistance rating.
        e. Class C interior finish may be used in  the  residential  rooms  of
      one-  and two-story motels when there is a direct exit from each room to
      the exterior.
        f. Interior finish when used in the following spaces shall be at least
      class B:
        (1) Kitchens, cooking spaces, and pantries in buildings classified  in
      occupancy groups other than J-2 and J-3.
        (2) Repair and maintenance rooms.
        (3) Boiler rooms and incinerator combustion rooms.
