Chapter 1-A - FULTON FISH MARKET DISTRIBUTION AREA AND OTHER SEAFOOD DISTRIBUTION AREAS

Section 22-201

Section 22-201 ::    
        
     
        §  22-201  Legislative  findings.  The  council  hereby finds that the
      fulton fish market, the center of New York's wholesale seafood  industry
      located in lower Manhattan, has for decades been corruptly influenced by
      organized  crime;  that  organized  crime's  corrupting  influence  over
      certain functions in the market, including  the  unloading  and  loading
      functions,  has  resulted  in  the  commission  of  numerous  crimes and
      wrongful acts there, including but not limited to physical  violence  or
      threats of violence, property damage, and thefts; that organized crime's
      corrupting influence over the market has fostered and sustained a cartel
      that  has  forced  seafood  suppliers  and  truckers  to  use particular
      unloading crews at fixed prices in an anticompetitive  scheme  that  has
      been  censured  by  a  federal  judge; that organized crime's corrupting
      influence has resulted in retailers parking on  city  streets  and  city
      property  nevertheless  having to pay high fees to private loading crews
      whose principal function  has  been  to  provide  "security"  for  those
      vehicles  and  their contents while retailers have purchased fish in the
      crime-ridden market area; and  that  these  corrupting  influences  have
      further  resulted  in  higher  prices  for  wholesale seafood than would
      otherwise have to be paid in the absence of this activity.  The  council
      further  finds  that  despite the repeated efforts of law enforcement to
      prosecute  crimes  there  and  the   presence   of   a   court-appointed
      administrator  for the market, the problem of organized crime corruption
      in the market has persisted. The council further finds that the market's
      businesses, including wholesalers,  seafood  deliverers,  unloaders  and
      loaders,  have  not  been  effectively regulated by the city in the past
      under existing laws  and  regulations  governing  public  markets,  even
      though  they  often  operate  on  city  property, albeit without leases,
      licenses and registration.  The  council  further  finds  that,  in  the
      absence  of an effective regulatory scheme, wholesalers have established
      a "gray market" in tenancies at rates in excess of those being  paid  to
      the  city  and  have  thus deprived the public of its rightful return on
      city property, and further,  that  unscrupulous  businesses  have  taken
      advantage  of  this  absence  of  regulation  to  engage  in  fraudulent
      practices,  such  as  the  creation  of  "phantom   wholesalers"   whose
      businesses disappear from the market before payment can be obtained from
      them  for  seafood  they  have  received  from  suppliers, and that such
      practices have discouraged suppliers from utilizing the market area.
        The council therefore finds and declares that in order to provide  for
      the  more  efficient and orderly conduct of business in the market area,
      to ensure that any such activities are lawfully  conducted,  to  promote
      the  economic vitality of the market and to protect the public interest,
      it is necessary for the commissioner of small business services to  have
      expanded  authority  to license and/or register businesses in the market
      area and to regulate the conduct of such businesses. In particular,  the
      council   finds   that,  in  order  to  achieve  these  objectives,  the
      commissioner of small business services should be  authorized  to  issue
      requests  for  licensing  proposals  to  provide  unloading  and loading
      services in the market area and, at his or her discretion, issue one  or
      more  unloading  and loading licenses based on the review and evaluation
      of responses received pursuant to such requests. In the  event  that  no
      appropriate  responses  are  received to such requests, the commissioner
      should be authorized to arrange for the  department  of  small  business
      services  itself  to perform unloading or loading services or to arrange
      that they be performed by a contractor or a designee of the department.
        The council recognizes  that  complaints  have  been  made  about  the
      conduct  of  seafood distribution activities outside the market area and
      finds further that the conditions which have given rise to corruption in
      the market area can exist in  other  areas  where  there  are  wholesale
    
      seafood  businesses  or  concentrations  of such businesses. The council
      also recognizes that representatives of such businesses have  threatened
      to  move  their operations elsewhere and that some may relocate to other
      parts  of  the city. The council thus finds and declares that it is also
      necessary for the  commissioner  of  small  business  services  to  have
      authority  to regulate seafood distribution in areas of the city outside
      the market area in which such seafood businesses may concentrate.
        Application of this chapter will enhance the city's ability to address
      organized crime corruption and to protect consumers and the many  honest
      business  persons  who  do  business  in  or with the market or at other
      seafood distribution areas. It is thus the council's intent  to  empower
      the  city  to  have  greater  regulatory  authority  over the conduct of
      business in the market and in other seafood distribution areas.

      applicant for a class B photo identification card lacks good  character,
      honesty  and integrity, require that such applicant be fingerprinted and
      provide to the commissioner the information set forth in  subdivision  a
      of  section  22-216  of  this  chapter. The commissioner may thereafter,
      after notice and opportunity to  be  heard,  refuse  to  issue  a  photo

      section.
        (iii) If at any time subsequent to the issuance of  a  class  B  photo
      identification  card,  there  is  reasonable  cause  to believe that the

      the  commissioner  may  require  such  person to be fingerprinted and to
      provide the background information required by subdivision a of  section

      registrant  who  has  submitted the information and fee required by this
      chapter or any rules promulgated thereunder. A photo identification card
      issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid until the  commissioner
      has either issued or denied a permanent identification card, unless such
      provisional  card  has  been  revoked  or  suspended  prior  thereto  in
      accordance with the procedures set forth in  this  chapter.  The  market
      manager,  may,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  also  make  provision for
      temporary identification cards, which shall be valid for a period not to
      exceed six weeks,  to  be  issued  to  persons  employed  by  unloaders,
      loaders,  wholesalers  and  seafood  deliverers  on  a seasonal or other
      temporary basis.

Section 22-204
--------------

Section 22-204 ::    
        
     
        §  22-204 Unloading business license required. a. It shall be unlawful
      to conduct an unloading business or otherwise provide unloading services
      in the  fulton  fish  market  distribution  area  without  having  first
      obtained an unloading business license from the commissioner pursuant to
      the  provisions of this section. An unloading business license shall not
      be transferable.
        b. The commissioner shall issue a request for licensing proposals  and
      shall,  at  his  or her discretion, issue one or more unloading business
      licenses based upon the review  and  evaluation  of  responses  received
      pursuant  to  such  request.  Such  request  for proposals shall solicit
      information regarding the qualifications of  proposers,  their  proposed
      methods of unloading, the labor and equipment they propose to utilize in
      the  unloading  operation,  rates proposed to be charged to wholesalers,
      procedures proposed to be used to comply with sanitary requirements, and
      any other information relating to performance standards,  responsibility
      and  service  that  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate. A proposal in
      response to a request for licensing proposals issued  pursuant  to  this
      section  shall  be  submitted  on behalf of a business entity by all the
      principals thereof  on  a  form  bearing  the  signatures  of  all  such
      principals.
        c.  A  license  issued  pursuant to this section shall state the name,
      address and telephone number of the licensee and the names and  business
      addresses  of  all  principals  of such licensee. A copy of such license
      shall be presented by the unloading  business  to  any  wholesaler  upon
      request.
        d.  A  license  issued  pursuant  to  this  section shall also contain
      conditions that:  (i)  specify  the  maximum  rates  to  be  charged  to
      wholesalers;  (ii)  specify  the  standard  and  level of performance of
      unloading and customer service which shall be maintained throughout  the
      term  of  the  license  to  ensure the continuing efficient unloading of
      seafood in the market area; (iii) require that  the  unloading  business
      obtain  a  performance  bond or such other guarantee of performance that
      the commissioner determines is appropriate and sufficient to  cover  any
      cost  incurred by the city in providing or performing unloading services
      pursuant to section 22-208 of this chapter  due  to  revocation  of  the
      license or default in the performance of the conditions specified in the
      license  and  specify  the amount of such performance bond or guarantee;
      and (iv)  prescribe  any  other  appropriate  requirements  relating  to
      performance  standards,  customer  service, security of performance, the
      use of city property, or such other matters as  the  commissioner  deems
      appropriate and necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
        e.  An  unloading  business  licensed pursuant to this section may not
      charge more for the provision of unloading  services  than  the  maximum
      rate  set  forth  in  the  license without the written permission of the
      commissioner, nor may an unloading business or any  principal,  employee
      or  agent  thereof  request  or  accept any other fees or gratuities for
      performing unloading services.
        f. No unloading business licensee, shall, by  contract  or  otherwise,
      assign or delegate to or engage any other business entity to provide the
      unloading  services  specified in the license, whether upon an emergency
      or any other  basis,  unless  the  commissioner  has  provided  specific
      written authorization therefor.
        g.  (i)  The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized, upon due notice and
      opportunity for a  hearing,  to  suspend  or  revoke  a  license  issued
      pursuant  to this section based upon a determination that there has been
      a default in the performance of the conditions specified in such license
      or for reasons set forth in sections 22-217 or 22-218 of  this  chapter.
      The commissioner shall also be authorized to pursue other remedies for a
    
      default  in  the performance of the conditions specified in the license,
      including but not limited to, reimbursement for any expenses incurred by
      the department in performing or  providing  unloading  services  in  the
      market area.
        (ii)  In  the  event  of  such  suspension  or revocation, or when the
      commissioner determines that additional unloading services are  required
      because  a  licensee has discontinued unloading operations in the market
      area or the existing unloading business  or  businesses  are  for  other
      reasons  unable  to provide adequate or sufficient unloading services in
      the market area, the commissioner may, as he or she  deems  appropriate,
      issue  a new license to one or more business entities which responded to
      the most recent request for licensing proposals, issue a new request for
      licensing  proposals  pursuant  to  this  section  or  arrange  for  the
      department,  a designee of the department or an entity under contract to
      the department to provide unloading services in the market area.  A  new
      license  issued  pursuant  to a request for licensing proposals shall be
      valid for the remainder  of  the  term  of  the  original  license.  The
      commissioner  may  also  solicit  expressions  of interest from business
      entities in providing unloading services on a temporary  basis  and  may
      issue  a  temporary license or licenses to provide unloading services in
      the market area to the most qualified of such entities  in  a  situation
      where the suspension or revocation of a license or the discontinuance of
      unloading  operations  by a licensee has created a shortage of unloading
      services in the market  area  or  the  existing  unloading  business  or
      businesses   are  for  other  reasons  unable  to  provide  adequate  or
      sufficient unloading services. A temporary license  issued  pursuant  to
      this subdivision shall be valid for a period of up to one year, provided
      that  such  license shall not extend beyond the remainder of the term of
      the original license. The  fee  for  such  temporary  license  shall  be
      prorated to the term of the original license.
        h. Prior to the expiration of the term of a license issued pursuant to
      this  section,  the commissioner shall issue a new request for licensing
      proposals pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Where the  term  of
      such  license  has  been  extended  for an additional period pursuant to
      section 22-213 of this chapter, the new request for licensing  proposals
      shall be issued prior to the expiration of such period.

Section 22-206 ::    
        
     
        §  22-206 Loading license required. a. It shall be unlawful to conduct
      a loading business or otherwise provide loading services in  the  fulton
      fish market distribution area, or provide such services to purchasers of
      seafood  from  wholesalers  in  such  market  area, without first having
      obtained a loading business license issued by the commissioner  pursuant
      to  the provisions of this section. A loading business license shall not
      be transferable.
        b. The commissioner shall issue a request for licensing proposals  and
      shall,  at  his  or  her  discretion, issue one or more loading business
      licenses based upon the review  and  evaluation  of  responses  received
      pursuant  to  such  request.  Such request for licensing proposals shall
      solicit information regarding  the  rates  proposed  to  be  charged  to
      provide  loading services in the market area, the areas in which loading
      operations are proposed to  be  conducted,  the  labor  proposed  to  be
      utilized  in  providing  loading  services,  and  any  other information
      relating to performance standards, responsibility and service  that  the
      commissioner  deems appropriate. A proposal in response to a request for
      licensing proposals issued pursuant to this section shall  be  submitted
      on  behalf  of a business entity by all the principals thereof on a form
      signed by all such principals.
        c. A license issued pursuant to subdivision b of  this  section  shall
      state  the  name,  address  and telephone number of the licensee and the
      names and business addresses of all principals of such licensee. A  copy
      of  such  license  shall  be  presented  by  the loading business to any
      wholesaler in  the  market  area  or  purchaser  of  seafood  from  such
      wholesalers  or  to  an  employee  of  such wholesaler or purchaser upon
      request.
        d. A license issued  pursuant  to  this  section  shall  also  contain
      conditions  that: (i) specify the maximum rate to be charged for loading
      services;
        (ii) specify the standard and level of performance of loading services
      which shall be maintained throughout the term of the agreement to ensure
      efficient loading services in the market;
        (iii) require that the loading business obtain a performance  bond  or
      such  other guarantee of performance that the commissioner determines is
      appropriate and sufficient to cover any cost incurred  by  the  city  in
      providing  or performing services related to loading pursuant to section
      22-208 of this chapter due to revocation of the license  or  default  in
      the  performance  of the conditions specified in the license and specify
      the amount of such performance bond or guarantee; and
        (iv)  prescribe  any  other  appropriate  requirements   relating   to
      performance  standards,  customer  service, security of performance, the
      use of city property, or such other matters as  the  commissioner  deems
      appropriate and necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
        e.  A  loading  business  licensed  pursuant to this chapter shall not
      charge more than the maximum rates specified  in  the  loading  business
      license,  nor may a loading business or any principal, employee or agent
      thereof request  any  other  fee  or  gratuity  for  performing  loading
      services.
        f.  No  loading  business  licensee,  shall, by contract or otherwise,
      assign or delegate to, or engage any other business  entity  to  provide
      loading  services  in  the market area, whether upon an emergency or any
      other basis, unless  the  commissioner  has  provided  specific  written
      authorization therefor.
        g.  (i)  The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized, upon due notice and
      opportunity for a  hearing,  to  suspend  or  revoke  a  license  issued
      pursuant  to this section based upon a determination that there has been
      a default in the performance of the conditions specified in such license
    
      or for reasons set forth in section 22-217 or 22-218  of  this  chapter.
      The commissioner shall also be authorized to pursue other remedies for a
      default  in  the performance of the conditions specified in the license,
      including but not limited to, reimbursement for any expenses incurred by
      the department in performing or providing loading services in the market
      area.
        (ii)  In  the  event  of  such  suspension  or revocation, or when the
      commissioner determines that additional loading  services  are  required
      because  a  licensee  has  discontinued loading operations in the market
      area or because the existing loading  business  or  businesses  are  for
      other  reasons unable to provide adequate or sufficient loading services
      in  the  market  area,  the  commissioner  may,  as  he  or  she   deems
      appropriate,  issue a new license to one or more business entities which
      responded to the most recent request for licensing proposals  previously
      issued,  issue  a  new  request for licensing proposals pursuant to this
      section or arrange for the department, a designee of the department or a
      business entity under contract to  the  department  to  provide  loading
      services  in the market area. A new license issued pursuant to a request
      for licensing proposals shall be valid for the remainder of the term  of
      the  original  license. The commissioner may also solicit expressions of
      interest from business entities  to  provide  loading  services  in  the
      market  area on a temporary basis and may also issue a temporary license
      or licenses to provide loading services in the market area to  the  most
      qualified  of  such  entities  in  a  situation  where the suspension or
      revocation of a license or the discontinuance of loading operations by a
      licensee has created a shortage of loading services in the  market  area
      or  the  existing  licensed loading business or businesses are for other
      reasons unable to provide adequate or  sufficient  loading  services.  A
      temporary license issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be valid for
      a  period  not  to exceed one year, provided that such license shall not
      extend beyond the remainder of the term of the original license. The fee
      for such temporary license shall be prorated to the term of the original
      license.
        h. Prior to the expiration  of  a  license  issued  pursuant  to  this
      section,  the  commissioner  shall  issue  a  new  request for licensing
      proposals pursuant to subdivision b of this section. Where the  term  of
      such  license  has  been  extended  for an additional period pursuant to
      section 22-213 of this chapter, the new request for licensing  proposals
      shall be issued prior to the expiration of such period.
        i.  Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall  be  construed  to  prevent  the
      commissioner from determining, for a reason other than those  set  forth
      in subdivision g of this section, that the department itself, a designee
      of  the  department  or an entity under contract to the department shall
      provide loading services on property owned by the  city  in  the  market
      area.  In  the  event  that  the  department  determines to provide such
      services, the provisions of subdivisions a through  g  of  this  section
      shall not apply.
        j.  Nothing  in  this  chapter  shall  be  construed  to  require  the
      department to authorize any party to use property owned by the  city  in
      the market area for the purpose of conducting a loading business.

Section 22-207 ::    
        
     
        §  22-207  Conduct  of  loading  businesses.  a.  The commissioner may
      establish by rule such measures as  he  or  she  deems  appropriate  and
      necessary to ensure the orderly and lawful conduct of loading businesses
      in  the  fulton fish market distribution area. Such measures may include
      the establishment of a  voucher  system  under  which  (i)  loaders  are
      prohibited  from accepting cash payments for performing loading services
      and (ii) persons wishing to have loading services performed for them may
      purchase vouchers from the market manager and present them to loaders in
      payment for loading services. Such vouchers shall thereafter be redeemed
      by the loading business for payment from the market manager.
        b. Such measures may also include, but shall not be  limited  to:  (i)
      appropriate  insurance  requirements;  (ii) prohibitions on interference
      with vehicles lawfully parked in the market area; (iii)  designation  of
      loading  areas in the market area, a requirement that a loading business
      obtain a lease or an occupancy permit  for  the  occupancy  of  property
      owned  by  the  city  when  a designated loading area is located on such
      property  and  the  establishment  of  a  fee  for  such  permit;   (iv)
      designation of hours during which loading services may be performed; (v)
      provisions  prescribing  maintenance  and  availability  of  records for
      inspection  by  the  market  manager  or  the  commissioner;  and   (vi)
      appropriate insurance and bonding requirements.

--------------

Section 22-208 ::    
        
     
        § 22-208 Loading and unloading services provided by the department. a.
      Notwithstanding  any  provisions  of  this  chapter to the contrary, the
      commissioner may  determine  that  the  public  interest  will  be  best
      protected  by the department providing loading and/or unloading services
      in the market. Such determination may also be made:  (i)  in  the  event
      that  suspensions  or  revocations  of  unloading  business  licenses or
      loading business licenses have resulted  in  an  insufficiency  of  such
      services in the market area; or
        (ii)  following  the  review  of  licensing  proposals  to  conduct an
      unloading business made pursuant to section 22-204 of this chapter or of
      licensing proposals to conduct  a  loading  business  made  pursuant  to
      section  22-206  of this chapter, based upon a finding that there are an
      insufficient  number  of  business  entities  submitting  proposals  for
      unloading  or  loading licenses, as the case may be, (1) whose principal
      or principals meet the  requirements  of  good  character,  honesty  and
      integrity set forth under this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant
      thereto; or (2) which are able to provide unloading or loading services,
      as  the  case  may  be,  in  a  manner consistent with the safe, lawful,
      orderly and efficient operation of the market area at  rates  which  are
      fair and reasonable to customers.
        b.  Where  the  commissioner has made a determination pursuant to this
      section, the department may provide unloading or  loading  services,  as
      the case may be, within the market area. Such services shall be provided
      in  accordance  with  all  rules  governing  the conduct of unloading or
      loading services prescribed under section 22-205 and section  22-207  of
      this chapter, other than insurance and bonding requirements.
        c.  During any period in which the department provides services in the
      market area under this section, it  shall  be  unlawful  for  any  other
      person  or  business entity to provide or perform or offer to provide or
      perform the same or similar  services  in  the  market  area;  provided,
      however,  that  where  the  department does not provide all unloading or
      loading services, as the case may be, in the market area,  an  unloading
      business or a loading business that possesses a valid license to conduct
      such business may continue to operate.
        d.  At  any  time  following  the commencement of a department service
      under this section, the commissioner may solicit interest  in  order  to
      determine  whether  there  are business entities interested in providing
      unloading or loading services, as the case may be, in  the  market  area
      who  meet  the  requirements  of this chapter and can substitute for the
      services  being  provided  by  the  department.  The  commissioner   may
      thereupon  issue  a  request  for  licensing  proposals  pursuant to the
      provisions of section 22-204 or section 22-206 of this chapter and issue
      a license pursuant to such sections. Notwithstanding the  provisions  of
      this  subdivision,  the  commissioner may at any time during a period in
      which the department is providing  services  pursuant  to  this  section
      consider  an  application  for  an  unloading  business  and/or  loading
      business license from a business entity  interested  in  providing  such
      service.  This  subdivision  shall  not  apply  when  the department has
      determined, pursuant to the provisions set forth  in  subdivision  g  of
      section  22-206,  that  the  department  itself  shall  perform  loading
      services on city owned property in the market area.
        e. For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  services  provided  by  the
      department  shall  include  those services provided by a designee of the
      department, an  entity  under  contract  to  the  department,  or  by  a
      combination thereof.

--------------

Section 22-209 ::    
        
     
        §  22-209  Wholesaler  registration  and stand permits required. a. It
      shall be unlawful for any business entity to conduct a wholesale seafood
      business in the fulton fish  market  distribution  area  without  having
      first  registered  with  and  obtained  a  registration  number from the
      commissioner.  A  registration  application  shall  be  submitted  by  a
      wholesale  seafood  business  upon a form prescribed by the commissioner
      containing such information as the commissioner shall  require  by  rule
      and  shall  be  signed  by  all  the  principals  of  such wholesaler. A
      registration number shall not be transferable. A  wholesaler  shall  not
      sublease  or  assign  to another wholesaler the premises, or any portion
      thereof with respect to which a wholesaler has  registered  his  or  her
      wholesale  seafood  business, unless such proposed sublessee or assignee
      has registered with and obtained a wholesaler registration  number  from
      the commissioner. A wholesale seafood business shall, in accordance with
      rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 22-223 of this
      chapter,  inform  the  commissioner  of  any  change  in  the  ownership
      composition of such business, or of the  addition  or  deletion  of  any
      principal at any time subsequent to registration.
        b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner
      may,  when  there  is reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the
      principals, employees or agents of a  wholesaler  lack  good  character,
      honesty  and  integrity,  require  that any or all of such principals be
      fingerprinted and provide to the commissioner the information set  forth
      in subdivision a of section 22-216 of this chapter. The commissioner may
      thereafter,  after  notice  and  the  opportunity to be heard, refuse to
      register such wholesaler for the reasons set forth in subdivision  b  of
      such section.
        (ii)  If  at  any time subsequent to the registration of a wholesaler,
      the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of  the
      principals,  employees  or agents of such wholesaler do not possess good
      character, honesty and integrity, the commissioner may require that  any
      or  all  of  such principals be fingerprinted and provide the background
      information required by subdivision a of section 22-216 of this  chapter
      and  may,  after  notice  and  the opportunity for a hearing, revoke the
      registration of such wholesaler for the reasons set forth in subdivision
      b of such section.
        c. No wholesaler shall place seafood on the  street  without  a  stand
      permit  issued  by  the  commissioner  pursuant to this chapter. A stand
      permit shall not be transferable. Except where the occupancy of  a  city
      street  under  a  stand  permit is authorized under the terms of a lease
      with the city of adjacent premises, the commissioner may set a charge to
      a wholesaler for such occupancy under a stand permit calculated upon the
      square footage of the area authorized to be used in such permit.
        d. A wholesaler shall not allow any other person to place  seafood  in
      the  space  for  which  such stand permit has been issued, except that a
      wholesaler may, on a temporary basis, permit the use of  such  space  by
      another  registered  wholesaler  who  has received a shipment of seafood
      that cannot be accommodated in the  space  from  which  such  registered
      wholesaler  operates.  No  fee may be charged for such temporary use and
      any such use shall be reported as soon as is practicable to  the  market
      manager  in  accordance  with  rules  promulgated  by  the  commissioner
      pursuant to this chapter.
        e. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions  c  and  d  of  this
      section,  the  holder of a stand permit may, after having first obtained
      the prior written approval of the commissioner, allow no more  than  one
      other  registered  wholesaler  at any one time to place seafood on other
      than a temporary basis in up to forty-nine  percent  of  the  space  for
      which such stand permit was issued. The holder of such permit may charge
    
      a  fee  for  the  use  of  such  space.  Such fee shall be calculated by
      multiplying the charge paid by the permit holder to the  city  for  such
      permit  by  the ratio of the amount of space being used to the amount of
      space  for  which  such  permit was issued and the ratio of the time for
      which such space will be used to the  period  of  time  for  which  such
      permit  was  issued; except that a holder of a stand permit may charge a
      fee exceeding the charge based on such calculation,  provided  that  the
      holder  of  such  permit  shall  remit  to  the  city an amount equal to
      seventy-five percent of the difference between the  actual  fee  charged
      and  the  charge  that would result from such calculation. A copy of the
      written agreement allowing the use of such space shall be filed with the
      market manager. Such agreement shall specify the amount of space and the
      period for which use of such space  is  authorized  and  the  fee  being
      charged.
        f.  A  stand  permit  shall  cease  to  be  valid upon the expiration,
      revocation or during a period of suspension of the registration  of  the
      wholesale  seafood  business to which such stand permit has been issued.
      However, where the holder  of  a  stand  permit  has,  pursuant  to  the
      provisions  of  subdivisions  d  or  e  of this section, allowed another
      registered wholesaler to use a portion  of  the  space  for  which  such
      permit was issued such other registered wholesaler shall be permitted to
      continue  to  conduct  business  in  such  space  during  such period of
      suspension.
        g. The market manager  shall  maintain  and  publish  a  list  of  all
      wholesalers  in  the  market  area  who  are  registered with the market
      manager and who possess stand permits  together  with  the  registration
      numbers  of such wholesalers and the numbers of such permits. The market
      manager shall make  such  list  available  to  suppliers,  shippers  and
      truckers  and  shall,  upon  request,  verify to suppliers, shippers and
      truckers whether such business entity is currently registered  with  the
      commissioner and/or possesses a valid stand permit.

      shall not be transferable.
        b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner

        § 22-212.1 Registration of labor union and labor organization. A labor
      union  or  labor  organization  representing  or  seeking  to  represent
      employees directly involved in the movement, handling or sale  of  goods

Section 22-213 ::    
        
     
        §  22-213  Fees  and  terms  of  licenses  and  registrations.  a. The
      commissioner shall by rule establish fees for the issuance  and  renewal
      of  registrations  and  of  licenses pursuant to this chapter in amounts
      sufficient to compensate the city  for  the  administrative  expense  of
      issuing  or  renewing  a  registration  or  license  and  the expense of
      inspections and other  activities  related  thereto.  A  license  issued
      pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for two years. A business entity
      that is licensed pursuant to this chapter shall provide the commissioner
      in  a  form prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to rules promulgated
      under this chapter with notice of at least  ten  business  days  of  the
      proposed  addition  of  a  new  principal  to  such business entity. The
      commissioner may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that  there
      exists  a  bona  fide  business  requirement  therefor. Except where the
      commissioner  determines  within  such  period,  based  on   information
      available  to  him  or  her, that the addition of such new principal may
      have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may
      add such new principal pending the completion of  review  under  section
      22-216 of this chapter. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to
      demonstrate  to the commissioner that the addition of such new principal
      pending completion of review under section 22-216 of this chapter  would
      not  have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the
      completion  of  such  review,  the  commissioner  determines  that  such
      principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall
      cease  to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or
      discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee, as
      the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.
        b. The commissioner shall be authorized to  extend  the  term  of  the
      license  for  an additional one year period at his or her discretion and
      shall establish an additional fee therefor.
        c. A registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall be  valid  for
      two years.

        b. The commissioner may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard,
      refuse  to  consider  a  licensing  proposal  from, or refuse to issue a
      license to, an  unloading  or  loading  business  or  a  class  A  photo
      identification  card  to  a  person required by subdivision a of section
      22-203 of this chapter to possess such identification card when  any  of
      the  principals  of  such  business or such person lacks good character,
      honesty and integrity or may defer the decision whether  to  issue  such
      license  or  photo identification card or to consider such proposal when
      there  is  a  pending  indictment  or  civil  or  criminal   action   or
      administrative   proceeding  as  provided  in  paragraph  (ii)  of  this
      subdivision. Such notice shall specify the reasons for such  refusal  or
      deferral.  In  making such determination, the commissioner may consider,
      but not be limited to: (i) failure by the applicant to provide  truthful
      information   in   connection  with  the  application;  (ii)  a  pending
      indictment or criminal action against such applicant for a  crime  which
      under  this  subdivision  would  provide a basis for the refusal of such
      license or photo identification card,  or  a  pending  civil  action  or
      administrative  proceeding  to which such applicant is a party and which
      relates to the fitness to conduct the business or perform the  work  for
      which the license or photo identification card is sought, in which cases
      the  commissioner  may  defer consideration of a proposal or application
      until a decision  has  been  reached  by  the  court  or  administrative
      tribunal  before which such action or proceeding is pending, unless such
      applicant demonstrates to the commissioner that such pending  action  or
      proceeding  should not be the basis for deferral of the license or photo
      identification card or consideration of the proposal;  (iii)  conviction
      of such applicant for a crime which, under article twenty-three-A of the
      correction  law,  would  provide  a basis for the denial of a license to
      conduct a business in the market area; (iv) commission of a racketeering
      activity or association with a person  who  has  been  convicted  for  a
      racketeering  activity  when  the applicant knew or should have known of
      such conviction, including but not limited to  the  offenses  listed  in
      subdivision  one  of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer
      Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. §1961 et seq) or  of
      an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law,
      as  such  statutes  may  be amended from time to time, or the equivalent
      offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction; (v)  association  with
      any  member  or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a
      federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when  the
      applicant  knew or should have known of the organized crime associations
      of such person; or (vi) failure to  pay  any  tax,  fine,  penalty,  fee
      related  to  the  applicant's  business  for  which  liability  has been
      admitted by the person liable therefor, or for which judgment  has  been
      entered  by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction
      and enforcement of such judgment has not been stayed.
        c. The factors set forth in subdivision b of this section  shall  also
      be  grounds  for the commissioner, pursuant to sections 22-209 or 22-211
      of this chapter, to refuse to register, or  to  suspend  or  revoke  the
      registration  of,  a wholesaler or a seafood deliverer; and to refuse to
      issue a photo identification card to, or to suspend or revoke the  photo
      identification  card  of, a principal, employee or agent of a wholesaler
      or seafood deliverer.
    
        d. The  commissioner  may  require  that  an  applicant  submitting  a
      licensing  proposal for any license required pursuant to this chapter or
      an application for registration as a  wholesaler  or  seafood  deliverer
      shall  submit such information regarding the applicant's business as the
      commissioner  shall  require  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  financial
      responsibility to  conduct  the  business  for  which  such  license  or
      registration  is  required,  and  may  refuse  to  issue  a  license  or
      registration to  any  applicant  who  has  not,  in  the  commissioner's
      determination, demonstrated such financial responsibility.
        e.  The  commissioner  may refuse to issue a license to, or consider a
      proposal from, the business of an applicant or issue  a  class  A  photo
      identification  card  to  a  person required by subdivision a of section
      22-203 of this chapter to possess such  identification  card  when  such
      applicant or such person has knowingly failed to provide the information
      and/or  documentation required by the request for licensing proposals or
      application or who has otherwise failed to demonstrate  eligibility  for
      such  license  or  photo  identification  card under this chapter or any
      rules promulgated pursuant thereto.
        f. The commissioner may refuse to issue a license to,  or  consider  a
      proposal  from,  the business entity of an applicant, or issue a class A
      photo identification card to a  person  required  by  subdivision  a  of
      section  22-203 of this chapter to possess such identification card when
      (i) the  business  entity  of  such  applicant  or  such  applicant  was
      previously  issued  a license or class A photo identification card under
      this chapter and such license  or  card  was  revoked  pursuant  to  the
      provisions of this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; or
      (ii)  such  applicant  has  been determined to have committed any of the
      acts which would be a basis  for  the  suspension  or  revocation  of  a
      license  pursuant  to  this  chapter  or  any rules promulgated pursuant
      thereto.

      entity to remain in the market area for such time  as  is  necessary  to
      allow  for  the expeditious sale, consignment or removal of a perishable
      product if, in the commissioner's  best  judgment,  such  permission  is
      consistent with the safety of the market area.

        §  22-220  Seizure;  forfeiture.  a.  Any police officer or authorized
      officer or employee of the department may, upon service of a  notice  of
      violation or criminal summons upon the owner or operator of a vehicle or
      other property or equipment seize such vehicle or such other property or
      equipment  which  such  police officer or authorized officer or employee
      has reasonable cause to believe is being used in connection with an  act
      constituting a violation of subdivision a of section 22-204, subdivision
      a  of section 22-206 or subdivision c of section 22-208 of this chapter.
      Any vehicle, property or equipment seized pursuant to  this  subdivision
      shall  be  delivered  into  the  custody  of  the  department  or  other
      appropriate agency. Where a notice  of  violation  has  been  served,  a
      hearing to adjudicate the violation underlying the seizure shall be held
      before  the  environmental control board within five business days after
      the seizure and such board shall render a decision within five  business
      days  after  the conclusion of the hearing. Where a criminal summons has
      been served, a  hearing  to  adjudicate  the  violation  underlying  the
      seizure  shall  be held before a court of competent jurisdiction. In the
      event that such court or the environmental control board determines that
      there has been no violation, the vehicle, property or equipment that was
      seized shall be released forthwith to the owner or any person authorized
      by the owner to take possession of such vehicle, property or equipment.
        b. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision a of  this  section  or
      where  notice  has been given that forfeiture will be sought pursuant to

      storage as set forth in the rules of the department. Where an action  or
      a proceeding relating to the violation underlying the seizure is pending
      in  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction or an administrative proceeding
      before the environmental control board, the vehicle or other property or
      equipment shall be released upon posting of a  bond  or  other  form  of
      security sufficient to cover the maximum fine or civil penalty which may
      be imposed for such violation and the costs of removal and storage.
        c.  Where  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  or the environmental
      control board makes a finding that the  vehicle  or  other  property  or
      equipment  has  not  been  used in connection with an act constituting a
      violation of subdivision a of section 22-204, subdivision a  of  section
      22-206  or  subdivision c of section 22-208 of this chapter, the vehicle

      or  any  person  authorized  by  the  owner  to  take possession of such
      vehicle, property or equipment.
        d. Any vehicle or other  property  or  equipment  that  has  not  been
      claimed  by  the  owner  within ten business days after mailing by first
      class mail to such owner of notice of a  determination  by  a  court  of
      competent  jurisdiction or by the environmental control board that there
      has been no violation or that the vehicle or other property or equipment
      was not used in connection with a violation of subdivision a of  section
      22-204,  subdivision  a  of  section  22-206 or subdivision c of section
      22-208 of  this  chapter  shall  be  deemed  by  the  department  to  be
      abandoned.   Any   vehicle   unclaimed  under  the  provisions  of  this
      subdivision shall be disposed of by the department pursuant  to  section
      twelve  hundred  twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law. Property or
      equipment other than a vehicle shall be disposed of by  sale  at  public
      auction  following  notice  by publication in the city record describing
      such property or equipment not less than ten business days prior to such
      sale. Such notice shall provide that the owner may reclaim such property
    
      or equipment until a date that shall be not  sooner  than  ten  business
      days from the date the notice is published.
        e.  (i)  In  addition  to  any  other  fines,  penalties, sanctions or
      remedies provided for in this chapter, a vehicle or  other  property  or
      equipment  which  has  been  seized  pursuant  to  subdivision a of this
      section and all rights, title and interest therein shall be  subject  to
      forfeiture  upon  notice and judicial determination thereof if the owner
      of such vehicle or other property or equipment has been found liable  by
      a  court of competent jurisdiction or the environmental control board on
      one or more prior  occasions  for  using  such  vehicle  or  such  other
      property or equipment in connection with an act constituting a violation
      of  subdivision  a of section 22-204, subdivision a of section 22-206 or
      subdivision c of section 22-208 of this chapter.
        (ii) A forfeiture proceeding  may  not  be  commenced  more  than  ten
      business  days after the receipt of a request by the owner for return of
      the vehicle, other property or equipment. If a forfeiture proceeding  is
      not commenced within such ten day period, the property shall be returned
      to  the  owner upon payment of the fine or civil penalty imposed and the
      costs of removal and storage. A vehicle or other property  or  equipment
      which  is  the subject of such action shall remain in the custody of the
      department or other appropriate agency pending the  final  determination
      of the forfeiture action.
        (iii)  Notice  of  the  institution  of the forfeiture action shall be
      served by first class mail on: (a) an owner of a vehicle at the  address
      set forth in the records maintained by the department of motor vehicles,
      or  for  vehicles  not  registered  in  New  York  state, in the records
      maintained by the state of  registration;  (b)  all  persons  holding  a
      security interest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed
      with  the  department  of  motor  vehicles pursuant to the provisions of
      title ten of the vehicle and traffic law, at the address  set  forth  in
      the  records  of  such department, or for vehicles not registered in New
      York state, all persons who hold a security  interest  in  such  vehicle
      which  security  interest has been filed with such state of registration
      and which persons are made known by such state to the department at  the
      address provided by such state of registration; and (c) for property and
      equipment  other  than  a  vehicle,  by  publication  in the city record
      describing such property or equipment and  by  notice  served  by  first
      class  mail  to  the  address  of  the person from whom such property or
      equipment was seized. Where such person is other than the owner of  such
      property  or  equipment, notice shall be served by first class mail both
      to such person and to the owner of such property or equipment where such
      owner is known, or can by reasonable effort, be  ascertained  or,  where
      such  owner  is not known or cannot by reasonable effort be ascertained,
      to the employer of the person from whom the property or other  equipment
      was  seized.  Notice  shall  also  be  served by first class mail to any
      person who holds a security interest in such property or equipment  when
      the  name  and  address of such person has been provided by the owner of
      the property or equipment or other person  from  whom  the  property  or
      equipment  was  seized,  or  is  otherwise  known  or can, by reasonable
      effort, be ascertained.
        (iv) Any owner who receives notice of the institution of a  forfeiture
      action  who wishes to claim an interest in the vehicle or other property
      or equipment subject to forfeiture may assert a claim in such action for
      the  recovery  of  the  vehicle  or  other  property  or  equipment   or
      satisfaction  of  the owner's interest in such vehicle or other property
      or equipment. Any person with a security interest  in  such  vehicle  or
      property  or  equipment  who  receives  notice of the institution of the
      forfeiture action who claims  an  interest  in  such  vehicle  or  other
    
      property or equipment may assert a claim in such action for satisfaction
      of such person's security interest.
        (v)  Forfeiture  pursuant to this subdivision shall be made subject to
      the interest of a person who claims an interest in the vehicle or  other
      property  or  equipment  pursuant to paragraph (iv) of this subdivision,
      where such person  establishes  that:  (a)  the  use  of  such  vehicle,
      property or equipment in connection with an act constituting a violation
      of  subdivision  a of section 22-204, subdivision a of section 22-206 or
      subdivision c of section 22-208 of this chapter that was the  basis  for
      seizure occurred without the knowledge of such person, or if such person
      had  knowledge of such use, that such person did not consent to such use
      by failing to do all that could reasonably have  been  done  to  prevent
      such use, and that such person did not knowingly obtain such interest in
      the  vehicle, property or equipment in order to avoid the forfeiture; or
      (b) that the conduct that was the basis for such seizure  was  committed
      by  any  person  other  than  such  person  claiming  an interest in the
      vehicle, property or equipment while such vehicle was unlawfully in  the
      possession  of  a person who acquired possession thereof in violation of
      the criminal laws of the United States or any state.
        (vi) The  department,  after  judicial  determination  of  forfeiture,
      shall,  at  its discretion, either: (a) retain such vehicle, property or
      equipment for the official use of the city; or (b) by public  notice  of
      at  least  five days, sell such forfeited vehicle, property or equipment
      at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be paid into the
      general fund of the city.
        (vii) In any forfeiture action commenced pursuant to this subdivision,
      where the court awards a  sum  of  money  to  one  or  more  persons  in
      satisfaction  of  such  person's  or  persons' interest in the forfeited
      vehicle, property or equipment, the total amount awarded to satisfy such
      interest or interests shall not exceed the amount of the net proceeds of
      the sale of the forfeited vehicle, property or equipment after deduction
      of the lawful expenses incurred by the city,  including  the  reasonable
      costs of removal and storage between the time of seizure and the date of
      sale.

      shall mean an owner as defined in section one hundred  twenty-eight  and
      in  subdivision  three of section three hundred eight of the vehicle and
      traffic law. The term "owner" of other property or equipment subject  to
      seizure  or  forfeiture pursuant to this section shall mean a person who

      a.  It  shall be unlawful for any business entity to conduct a wholesale
      seafood business  outside  the  fulton  fish  market  distribution  area
      without  having first registered and obtained a registration number from
      the commissioner. A registration application shall be upon  a  form  and
      contain  such  information as the commissioner shall specify by rule and
      shall be signed by all the principals of such wholesaler. A registration
      number shall not be transferable. The market manager  shall  maintain  a
      list  of  all  wholesalers  who  are registered pursuant to this section
      together with the registration numbers of  such  wholesalers  and  shall
      make  such list available to suppliers, shippers and truckers and shall,
      upon request, verify to  suppliers,  shippers  and  truckers  whether  a
      wholesaler is currently registered with the commissioner.
        b.  (i)  Upon  a  finding by the commissioner that there is reasonable
      cause to believe that there exists or that there is  the  potential  for
      corrupt,  deceptive  or  unconscionable business practices in an area or
      areas within the city outside the fulton fish market  distribution  area
      where  one or more wholesale seafood businesses has been established and
      that such business  practices  will  have  an  effect  inimical  to  the
      purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall declare such area to be
      a  seafood  distribution  area,  and  all  unloading businesses, loading
      businesses, wholesale seafood businesses and seafood delivery businesses
      which operate within such area, and the employees and/or agents of  such
      businesses,  shall  be  subject  to  all the provisions of this chapter;
      provided that when such provisions are applied to a seafood distribution
      area, the terms "fulton fish market distribution area" and "market area"
      as  contained  therein  shall  be  deemed  to   include   such   seafood
      distribution  area.  (ii)  The  commissioner shall by rule establish the
      boundaries of such seafood distribution area, based on determination  of
      the area in which activities related to the distribution of seafood take
      place,  and  may  promulgate rules for the orderly and lawful conduct of
      business in such area in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  sections
      22-205,  22-207, 22-210 and 22-212 of this chapter. (iii) No enforcement
      action shall be taken on or after the date on which the boundaries of  a
      seafood  distribution  area  have been established pursuant to paragraph
      (ii) of this subdivision against  (1)  any  business  entity  or  person
      required to be licensed and/or to possess a class A photo identification
      card  pursuant to this section unless and until one of the following has
      occurred: (aa) such business entity or person has failed  to  apply  for
      such  license or class A photo identification card by the date specified
      by the commissioner; (bb) any of the principals of such business  entity
      or  such  person has failed to submit to fingerprinting or to submit the
      background information required  pursuant  to  section  22-216  of  this
      chapter;  or  (cc)  such  license  or photo identification card has been
      denied by  the  commissioner;  (2)  against  any  wholesaler  registered
      pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of this section whose principals have been
      required by  the  commissioner  to  submit  to  the  fingerprinting  and
      disclosure  requirements  of  section  22-216 of this chapter unless and
      until one of the following has occurred  (aa)  the  principals  of  such
      wholesaler  have  failed  to  submit  to fingerprinting or to submit the
      required background information; or (bb) the  commissioner  has  revoked

      failed  to  apply for such class B photo identification card by the date
      specified by the commissioner; or (4) against  any  person  required  to
      possess a class B photo identification card who has been required by the
      commissioner to submit to the fingerprinting and disclosure requirements
      of  section 22-216 of this chapter unless and until one of the following
    
      has occurred: (aa) such person has failed to submit to fingerprinting or
      to submit the required background information by the date  specified  by
      the  commissioner;  or  (bb) the commissioner has denied the application
      for such class B photo identification card.
        c.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision b of this section,
      the commissioner  may  determine  that  licenses  to  conduct  unloading
      businesses  in  a  seafood distribution area may be appropriately issued
      without application of  the  provisions  set  forth  in  subdivisions  b
      through  f  of  section  22-204  of  this  chapter, and that licenses to
      conduct loading  businesses  in  a  seafood  distribution  area  may  be
      appropriately  issued without application of the provisions set forth in
      subdivisions b through h of section 22-206 of this  chapter.  Where  the
      commissioner has made such a determination, all other provisions of this
      chapter  including,  but  not limited to, the requirements for licenses,
      the issuance of licenses and suspensions  and  revocations  of  licenses
      shall  apply.  For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision:  (i)  the term
      "applicant submitting a proposal" as such term appears in section 22-216
      of this chapter shall, in the event of such determination, be deemed  to
      mean  an  applicant  for  an unloading license or a loading license in a
      seafood distribution area; and (ii) "loader" or "loading business" shall
      mean a business entity  that  has  designated  areas  in  which  loading
      services  take  place  or  that  operates  primarily  to provide loading
      services for purchasers of fish in a  seafood  distribution  area.  Such
      term  shall  not  include  a  business  entity that only incidentally or
      occasionally provides such services to such purchasers.
