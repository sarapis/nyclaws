        §28-401.8 Investigation of applicant. Every applicant for a license or
      certificate of competence shall submit to investigation as directed by a
      governmental  entity in order to determine the applicant's character and
      fitness. The applicant shall furnish the department with payment for the
      actual cost of conducting a background investigation. Failure to provide
      all  requested  and  completed  documents  in  a  timely  fashion   will
      constitute  an incomplete application and will result in a denial of the
      license or certificate of competence.
