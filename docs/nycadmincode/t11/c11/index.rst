      tenants  and/or  occupants  of  a  cooperative  corporation,  then  such
      cooperative corporation shall pay to  the  commissioner  of  finance  an
      excise  tax  which shall be equal to zero per centum of its gross income
      or its gross operating income, as the case may be.

Section 11-1104 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1104 Returns; requirements as to. a. Except as otherwise provided
      in  subdivision  e  of  this  section  with  respect  to taxable periods
      beginning  after  nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight,  on  or  before   the
      twenty-fifth  day  of  September, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and on or
      before the twenty-fifth day of  every  month  thereafter,  every  person
      subject  to  tax  hereunder shall file a return with the commissioner of
      finance on a form to be prescribed by  such  commissioner.  Such  return
      shall  state  the gross income or gross operating income as the case may
      be for the preceding calendar month, and shall contain any  other  data,
      information  or  other  matter  which  the  commissioner  of finance may
      require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance may  require
      at any further time a supplemental return hereunder, which shall contain
      any   data   upon   such  matters  as  such  commissioner  may  specify.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing  and  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
      subdivision  e  of  this  section,  a vendor of utility services, all of
      whose gross operating income is excluded from the  measure  of  the  tax
      imposed  by this chapter pursuant to subdivision e of section 11-1102 of
      this chapter during any taxable period, shall not be required to file  a
      return for such taxable period, provided, however, that on or before the
      first day of September of each year, any such vendor of utility services
      who  was not required to file a return for any taxable period during the
      period covered by the statement  required  to  be  filed  by  such  date
      pursuant  to  subdivision a of section 11-208.1 of this title shall file
      an information return covering such period in such form  and  containing
      such information as the commissioner of finance may specify.
        b. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns to be filed
      within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified
      in the notice.
        c.  If  a  return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return
      when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the commissioner of
      finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce  the  filing  of  such
      return or of a corrected return.
        d.  Where  the  state  tax commission changes or corrects a taxpayer's
      sales and compensating use tax liability with respect to the purchase or
      use of items for which a sales or compensating use  tax  credit  against
      the  tax  imposed by this chapter was claimed, the taxpayer shall report
      such change or correction to the commissioner of finance  within  ninety
      days  of  the  final  determination  of such change or correction, or as
      required by the commissioner of finance, and shall concede the  accuracy
      of  such  determination  or  state wherein it is erroneous. Any taxpayer
      filing an amended  return  or  report  with  the  state  tax  commission
      relating  to  the  purchase  or use of such items shall also file within
      ninety days thereafter a copy of such amended return or report with  the
      commissioner of finance.
        e.  With  respect  to taxable periods beginning after nineteen hundred
      ninety-eight, notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision  a  of  this
      section,  if  the  amount  of tax imposed hereunder on any person in the
      base year does not exceed one  hundred  thousand  dollars,  the  taxable
      period  for  which  such  person  is  required  to  file a return is the
      semiannual period described in paragraph i of  subdivision  fourteen  of
      section 11-1101 of this chapter, and such person shall file a return for
      each  semiannual  period  of the first calendar year beginning after the
      base year on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month  following  the
      end  of  each  such  taxable period. Such return shall be filed with the
      commissioner of finance on a form to be prescribed by such commissioner.
      Such return shall state the gross income or gross  operating  income  as
      the  case  may be for the preceding taxable period and shall contain any
      other data, information  or  other  matter  which  the  commissioner  of
    
      finance  may require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance
      may require at any further time a supplemental return  hereunder,  which
      shall  contain  any  data  upon  such  matters  as such commissioner may
      specify.  For  the  purposes  of  this subdivision, if the amount of tax
      imposed hereunder on such person in the base year is  for  a  period  of
      less  than  one  year, the amount of tax imposed on such person shall be
      annualized by multiplying the amount of tax imposed by a  fraction,  the
      denominator  of  which  is  the number of months or parts thereof during
      which the person was subject  to  the  tax  imposed  hereunder  and  the
      numerator  of  which is twelve. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
      of this subdivision, a person that first  becomes  subject  to  the  tax
      hereunder  shall  file  a  return for each month in the calendar year in
      which such person first becomes subject to such tax in  accordance  with
      subdivision a of this section.

Section 11-1105 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1105  Payment  of tax; credit for certain sales and compensating
      use taxes. a. At the time of  filing  each  return,  as  provided  under
      section 11-1104 of this chapter, each person taxable hereunder shall pay
      to  the  commissioner  of finance the taxes imposed by this chapter upon
      its gross income or gross operating income, as the case may be, for  the
      taxable  period  covered  by  such return, less any credit to which such
      person may be entitled under subdivision b of this section.  Such  taxes
      shall  be  due  and payable on the last day on which the return for such
      period is required to be filed, regardless of whether a return is  filed
      or  whether  the return which is filed correctly indicates the amount of
      tax due.
        b. (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the taxes  imposed
      by  this  chapter  for  the  amount  of sales and compensating use taxes
      imposed by section eleven hundred seven of  the  tax  law  which  became
      legally  due  on  or after, and which were paid on or after, July first,
      nineteen hundred seventy-seven but within the taxable period for which a
      credit is claimed, with respect to the purchase or use by  the  taxpayer
      of   machinery   or  equipment  for  use  or  consumption  directly  and
      predominantly in the production of steam  for  sale,  by  manufacturing,
      processing,  generating,  assembling, refining, mining or extracting, or
      telephone central office equipment or station  apparatus  or  comparable
      telegraph  equipment  for use directly and predominantly in receiving at
      destination  or  initiating  and  switching   telephone   or   telegraph
      communication, but not including parts with a useful life of one year or
      less  or  tools  or  supplies  used  in  connection with such machinery,
      equipment or apparatus.
        (2) The amount of  the  credit  provided  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision   shall   be  limited  to  the  amount  of  such  sales  and
      compensating use taxes paid during the taxable  period  covered  by  the
      return  under  this chapter on which the credit is taken less the amount
      of any credit or refund of such sales and compensating use taxes  during
      such taxable period. If such credit exceeds the amount of tax under this
      chapter  payable  for the taxable period in question, such excess amount
      shall be refunded or credited except in the case of a vendor of  utility
      services  who  is  entitled to a credit and/or refund for such sales and
      compensating use taxes under chapter five or  six  of  this  title.  The
      credit  allowed  under  this  subdivision  shall  be deemed an erroneous
      payment of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded in  accordance
      with  the  provisions  of  section  11-1108  of  this chapter, except as
      otherwise provided in the previous sentence.
        (3) Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax  imposed
      under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law for which the taxpayer
      has claimed a credit under the provisions of this subdivision in a prior
      taxable  period,  the  amount of such refund or credit shall be added to
      the tax imposed by section 11-1102 of this chapter of the taxable period
      in which such refund or credit of tax under section eleven hundred seven
      of the tax law is received.

      be  allowed a credit against the amount of taxes imposed by this chapter
      for the amount of special rebates and discounts made in accordance  with
      the  provisions  of section 22-602 of this chapter and for the amount of
      special rebates and discounts made in accordance with the provisions  of
      section  twenty-five-bb  of  the  general city law. Such credit shall be
      applied against the amount of tax  otherwise  required  to  be  paid  as
      provided  in  subdivision a of section 11-1105 of this chapter and shall
      be claimed for the taxable period  immediately  succeeding  the  taxable
      period in which such rebates or discounts are made.

-----------------

Section 11-1105.2 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1105.2 Relocation and employment assistance program credit. (a) A
      taxpayer  that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-B
      of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a  credit  against  the
      tax  imposed by this chapter, provided, however, that a taxpayer that is
      a vendor of utility services shall not be allowed the credit against the
      tax imposed by this chapter unless it elects as provided in  subdivision
      (d)  of  section  22-622  of the code to take the credit against the tax
      imposed by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall  be  the  amount
      determined  by  multiplying  one  thousand dollars or, in the case of an
      eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter  six-B  of  such
      title  twenty-two  a certification of eligibility dated on or after July
      first, two thousand, for  a  relocation  to  eligible  premises  located
      within  a  revitalization  area  defined  in  subdivision (n) of section
      22-621 of the code, three thousand dollars, by the  number  of  eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  by  the  taxpayer  during the
      calendar year with respect to particular premises to which the  taxpayer
      has relocated; provided, however, with respect to a relocation for which
      no  application  for  a certificate of eligibility is submitted prior to
      July first, two thousand three, to eligible premises that are  within  a
      revitalization  area,  if  the  date  of  such  relocation as determined
      pursuant to subdivision (j) of section 22-621 of the code is on or after
      January first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, and before July first,  two
      thousand,  the  amount  to  be  multiplied  by  the  number  of eligible
      aggregate employment shares shall be  one  thousand  dollars;  provided,
      however,  that  no  credit  shall  be  allowed for the relocation of any
      retail activity or hotel services; and provided that in the case  of  an
      eligible  business  that  has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such
      title  twenty-two  certifications  of  eligibility  for  more  than  one
      relocation,  the  portion  of  the  total  amount  of eligible aggregate
      employment shares to be multiplied by the  dollar  amount  specified  in
      this  subdivision  for  each such certification of a relocation shall be
      the number of total  attributed  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares
      determined  with  respect to such relocation pursuant to subdivision (o)
      of section 22-621 of the code. For purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the
      terms   "eligible  aggregate  employment  shares",  "relocate",  "retail
      activity" and "hotel services"  shall  have  the  meanings  ascribed  by
      section 22-621 of the code.
        (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with  respect  to  particular
      premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be  allowed  for  the
      taxable  periods  in  the first calendar year during which such eligible
      aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises
      and for taxable periods in any of the twelve succeeding  calendar  years
      during  which  eligible  aggregate employment shares are maintained with
      respect to such premises, provided  that  the  credit  allowed  for  the
      taxable  periods  in  the  twelfth  succeeding  calendar  year  shall be
      calculated by multiplying the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares   maintained  with  respect  to  such  premises  in  the  twelfth
      succeeding calendar year by  the  lesser  of  one  and  a  fraction  the
      numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  in the calendar year of
      relocation less the number of  days  the  eligible  business  maintained
      employment  shares  in  the  eligible  premises  in the calendar year of
      relocation and the denominator of which is the number of  days  in  such
      twelfth  succeeding year during which such eligible aggregate employment
      shares  are  maintained  with  respect  to  such  premises.  The  credit
      allowable  under this section shall be applied against the amount of tax
      otherwise required to be  paid  for  the  last  taxable  period  of  the
      calendar  year  as  provided in subdivision a of section 11-1105 of this
    
      chapter, shall  be  deducted  from  the  taxpayer's  tax  prior  to  the
      deduction  of  the credit provided in subdivision b of such section, and
      shall be claimed on the tax return for the last taxable  period  of  the
      calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, if
      the  amount  of  the  credit  allowable  under  this subdivision for any
      calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last  taxable  period  in
      such  calendar  year,  the  excess may be carried over, in order, to the
      immediately  succeeding  taxable  periods  in   the   five   immediately
      succeeding  calendar  years and, to the extent not previously allowable,
      shall be applied against the tax otherwise required to be paid for  such
      periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax
      prior  to  the  deduction  of  the  credit  provided in subdivision b of
      section 11-1105 of this chapter. With respect to the last taxable period
      in a calendar year, the credit for such calendar  year  shall  be  taken
      prior  to  any  carryover  credit.  If in any period there are carryover
      credits available from more than one year, such credits shall be applied
      against the tax in the order in which they were earned with  the  oldest
      available credit being taken first.
        (c)  In  the  case  of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of
      eligibility pursuant to chapter six-B of title twenty-two  of  the  code
      dated  on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible
      premises located within the revitalization area defined  in  subdivision
      (n)  of  section  22-621  of  the  code,  the credits allowed under this
      section, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than once,
      the  portion  of  such  credits  attributed  to  such  certification  of
      eligibility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, against the tax
      imposed by this chapter for the calendar year of such relocation and for
      the four calendar years immediately succeeding the calendar year of such
      relocation,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  erroneous payments of tax by the
      taxpayer to be credited or refunded, in accordance with  the  provisions
      of  section  11-1108  of  this  chapter.  For  such calendar years, such
      credits or portions thereof may not be carried over  to  any  succeeding
      taxable  year;  provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply
      to any relocation for  which  an  application  for  a  certification  of
      eligibility  was  not  submitted prior to July first, two thousand three
      unless the date of such relocation  is  on  or  after  July  first,  two
      thousand.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1105.3
-----------------

Section 11-1105.3 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1105.3  Lower Manhattan relocation employment assistance credit.
      (a) A taxpayer that has obtained the certifications required by  chapter
      six-C  of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against
      the tax imposed by this chapter, provided, however, that a taxpayer that
      is a vendor of utility services shall not be allowed the credit  against
      the  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  unless  it  elects  as provided in
      subdivision (d) of section 22-624 of the code to take the credit against
      the tax imposed by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall  be  the
      amount determined by multiplying three thousand dollars by the number of
      eligible  aggregate  employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during
      the calendar year  with  respect  to  eligible  premises  to  which  the
      taxpayer  has  relocated;  provided,  however,  that  no credit shall be
      allowed for the relocation of any retail activity or hotel services. For
      purposes of this subdivision, the terms "eligible  aggregate  employment
      shares",  "eligible  premises", "relocate", "retail activity" and "hotel
      services" shall have the meanings ascribed  by  section  22-623  of  the
      code.
        (b)  The  credit  allowed  under this section with respect to eligible
      aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises
      to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be  allowed  for  the  taxable
      period  in which the relocation to eligible premises takes place and for
      succeeding taxable periods in the calendar year of the relocation and in
      any of the  twelve  succeeding  calendar  years  during  which  eligible
      aggregate  employment  shares  are  maintained  with respect to eligible
      premises, provided that the credit allowed for the  taxable  periods  in
      the  twelfth succeeding calendar year shall be calculated by multiplying
      the number of  eligible  aggregate  employment  shares  maintained  with
      respect  to eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding calendar year by
      the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
      days in the calendar year of relocation less  the  number  of  days  the
      taxpayer  maintained  employment  shares  in  eligible  premises  in the
      calendar year of relocation and the denominator of which is  the  number
      of  days  in  such  twelfth  succeeding  calendar year during which such
      eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such
      premises. The credit allowable  under  this  section  shall  be  applied
      against  the  amount  of  tax otherwise required to be paid for the last
      taxable period of the calendar year as  provided  in  subdivision  a  of
      section  11-1105  of this chapter, shall be deducted from the taxpayer's
      tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in  subdivision  b  of
      such  section  but after the credit provided for in section 11-1105.2 of
      this chapter, and shall be claimed  on  the  tax  return  for  the  last
      taxable  period  of the calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision
      (c) of this section, if the amount of the credit  allowable  under  this
      subdivision  for any calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last
      taxable period in such calendar year, the excess may be carried over, in
      order, to  the  immediately  succeeding  taxable  periods  in  the  five
      immediately  succeeding calendar years and, to the extent not previously
      allowable, shall be applied against the tax  otherwise  required  to  be
      paid  for such periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the
      taxpayer's tax  prior  to  the  deduction  of  the  credit  provided  in
      subdivision  b  of  section 11-1105 of this chapter but after the credit
      provided for in section 11-1105.2 of this chapter. With respect  to  the
      last  taxable  period  in  a calendar year, the credit for such calendar
      year shall be taken prior to any carryover  credit.  If  in  any  period
      there  are  carryover  credits  available  from more than one year, such
      credits shall be applied against the tax in the order in which they were
      earned with the oldest available credit being taken first.
    
        (c) The credits allowed under this section, against the tax imposed by
      this chapter for the calendar year of the relocation and  for  the  four
      taxable   years   immediately  succeeding  the  calendar  year  of  such
      relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to
      be  credited  or  refunded,  without  interest,  in  accordance with the
      provisions of section 11-1108 of this chapter. For such calendar  years,
      such  credits  or  portions  thereof  may  not  be  carried  over to any
      succeeding calendar year.

Section 11-1106 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1106  Determination  of tax. In case the return required by this
      chapter shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory or if such return is not
      filed, the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of the tax
      due from such information as is obtainable, and if necessary the tax may
      be estimated  upon  the  basis  of  external  indices.  Notice  of  such
      determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the
      tax.  Such  determination  shall  finally  and  irrevocably fix such tax
      unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days  after
      the  giving  of  notice of such determination or, if the commissioner of
      finance has established a conciliation  procedure  pursuant  to  section
      11-124  of  the  code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested a conciliation
      conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the  mailing
      of   a   conciliation   decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a  hearing,  or  unless  such
      commissioner  of  his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such
      hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc  from
      the  decision  rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner
      and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax  appeals  tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals  tribunal
      shall  give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is
      assessed and to the commissioner of  finance.  A  decision  of  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  sitting  en  banc  shall  be  reviewable  for  error,
      illegality, unconstitutionality or any  other  reason  whatsoever  by  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules if instituted by the person against  whom  the  tax  was  assessed
      within  four  months  after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals
      tribunal decision. A proceeding under such article of such law and rules
      shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless (a) the amount of  any  tax
      sought to be reviewed with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall
      first  be  deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be
      filed with such commissioner an undertaking, issued by a surety  company
      authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state  and approved by the
      superintendent  of  insurance  of  this  state  as   to   solvency   and
      responsibility,  in  such  amount and with such sureties as a justice of
      the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding
      be  dismissed  or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at
      the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the  commissioner
      of  finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and
      interest thereon stated in such decision, plus  the  costs  and  charges
      which  may  accrue  against  it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in
      which event the taxpayer shall not be required to  deposit  such  taxes,
      penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.

        §  11-1107  Assessment  of tax where change or correction of sales and
      compensating use tax liability involved.  a.  If  a  taxpayer  fails  to
      comply  with  subdivision  d  of  section 11-1104 of this chapter in not
      reporting a change or correction of its sales and compensating  use  tax
      liability  or  in  not  filing  a  copy  of  an amended return or report
      relating to its sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the
      mode and time of assessment provided for  in  section  11-1106  of  this
      chapter,  the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon
      such changed or corrected sales and compensating use tax  liability,  as
      same  relates  to  credits claimed under this chapter, by mailing to the
      taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying  the  amount  of  the
      deficiency,   and  such  deficiency,  together  with  the  interest  and
      penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed  on  the  date
      such  notice  is  mailed  unless within thirty days after the mailing of
      such notice a report of the state change or correction or a copy  of  an
      amended  return  or  report,  where  such  copy  was  required, is filed
      accompanied by a statement showing wherein such state determination  and
      such  notice  of additional tax due are erroneous. Such notice shall not
      be considered as a notice of determination for the purposes  of  section
      11-1106 of this chapter.
        b.  If  a report filed pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-1104 of
      this chapter concedes the accuracy of a state change  or  correction  of
      sales  and  compensating  use  tax  liability,  any  deficiency  in  tax
      resulting therefor shall be deemed assessed on the date of  filing  such
      report.

Section 11-1108 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1108  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid, if application for such refund shall be made  to  the
      commissioner  of finance within three years from the time the return was
      filed or two years from the time the tax was  paid,  whichever  of  such
      periods  expires later, or if no return was filed, within two years from
      the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within  the  three-year
      period,  the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion
      of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the  filing
      of  the  claim  plus  the period of any extension of time for filing the
      return. If the claim is not filed within the three-year period,  but  is
      filed  within  the  two-year  period, the amount of the credit or refund
      shall not exceed the portion of  the  tax  paid  during  the  two  years
      immediately  preceding  the  filing  of  the claim. Whenever a refund or
      credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall
      state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer
      in writing. The commissioner of finance  may,  in  lieu  of  any  refund
      required  to  be  made,  allow  credit therefor on payments due from the
      applicant.
        b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying  a  refund
      or  credit  pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and
      irrevocable unless the applicant  for  such  refund  or  credit,  within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner   of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation  procedure
      pursuant  to  section  11-124  and  the  applicant   has   requested   a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation  of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both
      (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  files  a
      petition  with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for
      a refund or  credit,  made  as  herein  provided,  shall  be  deemed  an
      application  for  a  revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained
      of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal  sitting  en
      banc  from  the  decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one
      hundred  seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals
      tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and  to  the
      commissioner  of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a
      proceeding under article seventy-eight of the  civil  practice  law  and
      rules  to  review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc
      if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four  months
      after  the  giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case
      of an application by a taxpayer, a final determination of  tax  due  was
      not previously made.
        c.  If  a  taxpayer is required by subdivision d of section 11-1104 of
      this chapter to file a report or amended return in respect of  a  change
      or correction of its sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for
      credit  or  refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by
      the taxpayer within one year from the time such report or amended return
      was required  to  be  filed  with  the  commissioner  of  finance.  This
      subdivision  shall  not  affect  the time within which or the amount for
      which a claim for  credit  or  refund  may  be  filed  apart  from  this
      subdivision.
        d.  A  person  shall  not  be entitled to a revision, refund or credit
      under this section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which  had  been
      determined  to  be  due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1106 or
    
      11-1107 of this chapter where  he  or  she  has  had  a  hearing  or  an
      opportunity  for  a hearing, as provided in said sections, or has failed
      to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No  refund
      or  credit  shall  be  made  of  a tax, interest or penalty paid after a
      determination by the commissioner of finance made  pursuant  to  section
      11-1106  or  11-1107  of  this  chapter  unless  it  be  found that such
      determination was erroneous, illegal or  unconstitutional  or  otherwise
      improper,  by  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  after  a  hearing  or of the
      commissioner of finance's own motion or, if such  tax  appeals  tribunal
      affirms  in  whole  or  in part the determination of the commissioner of
      finance, in a  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil
      practice  law  and  rules pursuant to the provisions of said section, in
      which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the  tax,
      interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.

      shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for  the  review
      of  tax  liability  imposed  by  this  chapter;  and no determination or
      proposed determination of tax or determination on  any  application  for
      refund  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  nor any decision by the tax
      appeals tribunal or any of  its  administrative  law  judges,  shall  be
      enjoined  or  reviewed  by an action for declaratory judgment, an action
      for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in
      the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting  en  banc,  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by  a  declaratory
      judgment  if  he  or  she  institutes  suit  within  thirty days after a
      deficiency assessment is made and pays  the  amount  of  the  deficiency
      assessment  to  the  commissioner of finance prior to the institution of
      such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section  11-1106  of
      this chapter.

---------------

Section 11-1111 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1111  Proceedings  to  recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall
      fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by  this  chapter  as
      herein  provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the
      commissioner of finance, bring or cause  to  be  brought  an  action  to
      enforce  payment  of  the same against the person liable for the same on
      behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York  or
      of  any  other  state  or  of  the  United  States.  If,  however,  such
      commissioner in his or her discretion believes that a  taxpayer  subject
      to  the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the
      state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which  tax  or  penalties
      might  be  satisfied  and  that any such tax or penalty will not be paid
      when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty  to  be  immediately
      due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.
        b.  As  a  further additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of
      finance may issue a warrant, directed to the  city  sheriff,  commanding
      him  or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such
      person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount
      thereof, with any penalties and the cost of executing the warrant and to
      return such warrant to such commissioner and to pay to him  or  her  the
      money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of
      such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt
      of  the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof and thereupon
      such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the  name  of  the  person
      mentioned  in  the  warrant  and the amount of the tax and penalties for
      which the warrant is issued and  the  date  when  such  copy  is  filed.
      Thereupon  the  amount  of  such warrant so docketed shall have the full
      force and effect of a judgment and shall become a lien upon the title to
      and interest in real and personal property of the  person  against  whom
      the  warrant  is  issued.  The  city sheriff shall then proceed upon the
      warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by  law
      in  respect  to executions against property upon judgments of a court of
      record, and for services in executing the warrant he  or  she  shall  be
      entitled  to  the  same  fees  which  he  or she may collect in the same
      manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance  a  warrant  of
      like  terms,  force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer
      or employee of the department of finance and in  the  execution  thereof
      such  officer or employee shall have all the power conferred by law upon
      sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee or  compensation  in
      excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a
      warrant  is  returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance
      may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also  have  the  same
      remedies  to  enforce  the  amount  due  thereunder  as  if the city had
      recovered judgment therefor and  execution  thereon  had  been  returned
      unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  there  is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of
      any part or the whole of a stock of merchandising  or  of  fixtures,  or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business
      of  the  seller,  transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary
      course of trade and in the regular prosecution  of  said  business,  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking
      possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise  and  fixtures,
      or  paying  therefor,  notify  the commissioner of finance by registered
      mail of the proposed  sale  and  of  the  price,  terms  and  conditions
      thereof,  whether  or  not  the  seller,  transferor  or  assignor,  has
      represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or  assignee  that
      it  owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, whether or not the purchaser,
      transferee or assignee has knowledge that  such  taxes  are  owing,  and
      whether or not any such taxes are in fact owing.
    
        Whenever  the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give the
      notice to the commissioner of finance required by this  subdivision,  or
      whenever  such  commissioner  shall  inform the purchaser, transferee or
      assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of
      money,  property  or choses in action, or other consideration, which the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer  over  to  the
      seller,  transferor  or  assignor  shall  be subject to a first priority
      right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or  thereafter  determined
      to  be  due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the
      purchaser, transferee or  assignee  is  forbidden  to  transfer  to  the
      seller,  transferor  or  assignor  any  such  sums of money, property or
      choses in action to the extent of the amount of the  city's  claim.  For
      failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision the purchaser,
      transferee  or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities
      and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the  uniform
      commercial  code  shall be personally liable for the payment to the city
      of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to  the
      city  from  the seller, transferor or assignor and such liability may be
      assessed and enforced in the same manner as the  liability  for  tax  is
      imposed under this chapter.
        d.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed  for
      payment  (without  regard to any extension of time granted for payment),
      interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner  of  finance
      pursuant  to  subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at
      the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for  the
      period  from  such  last  date  to the date of payment. In computing the
      amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded  daily.
      Interest  under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof
      is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to section 11-1106 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to  subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        (3)  If  any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect
      to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection  (a)  of
      section  six  thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand
      forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine  of  the
      internal  revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, respectively, and
      the payee fails to include any portion of such payment in  gross  income
      or  gross  operating  income,  when required under this chapter to be so
      included, any portion of an underpayment attributable  to  such  failure
      shall be treated, for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence
      in  the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any
      penalty is imposed under this subdivision by  reason  of  the  preceding
      sentence,  the  amount  of  the penalty imposed by paragraph one of this
      subdivision shall be five percent of the  portion  of  the  underpayment
      which  is  attributable  to  the  failure  described  in  the  preceding
      sentence.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an  underpayment  of
      tax  is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to
      two times the underpayment.
        (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of  any  other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
    
        (e)  Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more  than  one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any other amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
      commissioner of finance. The commissioner  of  finance  shall  have  the
      power,  in  his  or  her  discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall  be  paid
      and  disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter.
      Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as  the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g)  (1)  Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed to be set at seven and one-half  percent  per  annum.  Such  rate
      shall  be  the  rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but
      shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per  annum.  Any  such
      rate  set  by  the  commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any
      portion thereof, which remain or become due on  or  after  the  date  on
      which  such  rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to
      interest computed or computable  for  periods  or  portions  of  periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2)  General  rule.  The  rate  of interest set under this subdivision
      shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate  as  provided  under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A)  The  federal  short-term  rate for any month shall be the federal
      short-term rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  the
      treasury  during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section
      twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
      connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
      internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest
      full  percent  (or,  if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)  In  general.  Except  as  provided  in  clause   (ii)   of   this
      subparagraph,  the  federal  short-term rate for the first month in each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii) Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.  The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of April,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with  respect  to  setting  the
      rate   of   interest  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner  of  finance  shall
      cause  to  be  published  in the city record, and give other appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later than twenty days preceding the first day of the  calendar  quarter
      during  which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of
      such interest rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph  (a)  of
      subdivision  five  of section one thousand forty-one of the city charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h) Miscellaneous.  (1)  The  certificate  of  the  commissioner  of
      finance  to  the  effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has
      not been filed, or that information has not been  supplied  pursuant  to
      the provisions of this chapter shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
    
        (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (i)   Substantial   understatement  of  liability.  If  there  is  a
      substantial understatement of tax for any taxable period, there shall be
      added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of  the  amount  of  any
      underpayment  attributable  to such understatement. For purposes of this
      subdivision, there is  a  substantial  understatement  of  tax  for  any
      taxable  period  if  the  amount  of  the understatement for the taxable
      period exceeds the greater of ten percent of  the  tax  required  to  be
      shown on the return for the taxable period or five thousand dollars. For
      purposes  of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the
      excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the  return  for
      the taxable period, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on
      the  return,  reduced  by  any rebate. The amount of such understatement
      shall be  reduced  by  that  portion  of  the  understatement  which  is
      attributable  to  the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there
      is or was substantial authority for such treatment,  or  any  item  with
      respect  to  which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment
      are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the
      return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or  any  part  of  the
      addition  to  tax  provided  by  this  subdivision  on  a showing by the
      taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part
      thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.

        * (j) Aiding  or  assisting  in  the  giving  of  fraudulent  returns,
      reports,  statements  or  other  documents. (1) Any person who, with the
      intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or  as
      an  incident  to the performance of other services for which such person
      receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or  advise
      the  preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter
      arising under this title of  any  return,  report,  statement  or  other
      document  which  is  fraudulent  or  false as to any material matter, or
      supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such  falsity
      or  fraud  is  with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or
      required to present such return, report,  statement  or  other  document
      shall pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.
        (2)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision, the term
      "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to  do
      an  act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by
      a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any  other  person
      (whether  or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer
      involved) over whose activities the person has  direction,  supervision,
      or control.
        (3)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision, a person
      furnishing typing, reproducing,  or  other  mechanical  assistance  with
      respect  to  a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted
      in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.
        (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be  in  addition  to
      any other penalty provided by law.
        * NB Added Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (k)  Failure  to  include  on  return information relating to issuer's
      allocation percentage. Where a return is filed but does not contain  (1)
      the  information necessary to compute the taxpayer's issuer's allocation
      percentage,  as  defined  in  subparagraph  one  of  paragraph  (b)   of
      subdivision  three  of  section  11-604 of this title, where the same is
      called for on the return, or, (2)  the  taxpayer's  issuer's  allocation
      percentage,  where the same is called for on the return but where all of
    
      the information necessary for the computation of such percentage is  not
      called  for  on the return, then unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  there  shall  be
      added to the tax a penalty of five hundred dollars.
        (l)  False or fraudulent document penalty. Any taxpayer that submits a
      false or fraudulent document to the department shall  be  subject  to  a
      penalty  of  one hundred dollars per document submitted, or five hundred
      dollars per tax return submitted. Such penalty shall be in  addition  to
      any other penalty or addition provided by law.

Section 11-1115 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1115 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by such person pursuant to the provisions of  this  chapter  or  in  any
      application  made  by  him  or  her,  or, if no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action by the city taken  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty provided by this chapter. However,  except  in  the  case  of  a
      wilfully  false  or  fraudulent  return with intent to evade the tax, no
      assessment  of  additional  tax  imposed  under  a  local  law   enacted
      subsequent  to  July first, nineteen hundred thirty-eight, shall be made
      after the expiration of more than three  years  from  the  date  of  the
      filing  of  a  return,  provided, however, that where no return has been
      filed, or where the taxpayer fails to file a report or return in respect
      of a change or correction in the amount of sales  and  compensating  use
      tax  liability  as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.
      Where the taxpayer files a report or return in respect of  a  change  or
      correction  in  sales and compensating use tax liability, as required by
      subdivision d of section 11-1104, an assessment may be made at any  time
      within  two  years  after  such  report  or  return was filed, provided,
      however, that this sentence shall not affect the time  within  which  an
      assessment may otherwise be made.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  If  any  return,  claim,  statement, notice, application, or other
      document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
      within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  finance,
      the  tax  appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which
      or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to  which  or  to
      whom  such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States
      postmark stamped on the envelope shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      delivery.  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing of such document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including  any
      extension  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom  the  document
      is  required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required
      to be made. If any document is sent by United  States  registered  mail,
      such  registration  shall be prima facie evidence that such document was
      delivered to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
    
      of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to
      provide  by  regulation  the  extent  to  which  the  provisions  of the
      preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery  and
      the  postmark  date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in
      subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the  case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the  extent  provided  by  regulation  of the commissioner of finance or
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
        e. When the last  day  prescribed  under  authority  of  this  chapter
      (including  any  extension  of  time)  for performing any act falls on a
      Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of  such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

        §  11-1116  Returns  to be secret. a. Except in accordance with proper
      judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for
      the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, or any officer or
      employee of the department of finance or the  tax  appeals  tribunal  to
      divulge  or  make  known  in  any  manner,  the  receipts  or  any other
      information relating to the business of  a  taxpayer  contained  in  any
      return  required  under  this  chapter.  The  officers  charged with the
      custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them  or
      evidence  of  anything  contained in them in any action or proceeding in
      any court, except on behalf of the city or the commissioner of  finance,
      or  on  behalf  of  any  party  to  any  action  or proceeding under the
      provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown  thereby  are
      directly  involved  in  such  action  or  proceeding, in either of which
      events, the court may require  the  production  of,  and  may  admit  in
      evidence,  so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are
      pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein  shall
      be  construed  to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or his or her duly
      authorized representative of a certified copy of  any  return  filed  in
      connection  with  his  or  her  tax,  nor to prohibit the publication of
      statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of  particular
      returns  and  the  items  thereof,  or the inspection by the corporation
      counsel of the city or other legal representatives of such city  of  the
      return of any taxpayer who shall bring action or proceeding to set aside
      or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding
      has  been  instituted  or  is  contemplated for the collection of a tax,
      penalty or interest. Returns shall be  preserved  for  three  years  and
      thereafter  until  the  commissioner  of  finance  permits  them  to  be

Section 11-1119 ::    
        
     
        §   11-1119  Determinations  of  place  of  primary  use  of  wireless
      telecommunications  services.  a.  A  home  service  provider  shall  be
      responsible  for  obtaining  and  maintaining  the  customer's  place of
      primary use as defined in subdivision twenty of section 11-1101 of  this
      chapter.  Except  as  provided  in subdivision b of this section, if the
      home service provider's reliance on  the  information  provided  by  its
      customer is in good faith: (1) the home service provider can rely on the
      applicable  residential  or business street address supplied by the home
      service provider's customer; and (2) the home service provider shall not
      be held liable for any additional taxes under this chapter  based  on  a
      different determination of the place of primary use.
        b.  The  commissioner  of finance, or the commissioner of taxation and
      finance of the state of New  York  on  behalf  of  the  commissioner  of
      finance,  may determine that the address used by a home service provider
      for purposes of this chapter does not meet the definition  of  place  of
      primary  use as defined in subdivision twenty of section 11-1101 of this
      chapter and may give binding notice to  the  home  service  provider  to
      change  the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of
      notice of determination if:
        (1) where the determination is made by the  commissioner  of  finance,
      such   commissioner   obtains   the   consent  of  all  affected  taxing
      jurisdictions  within  this  state  before   giving   such   notice   of
      determination; and
        (2) before the commissioner of finance or the commissioner of taxation
      and finance of the state of New York gives such notice of determination,
      the  customer is given an opportunity to demonstrate, in accordance with
      applicable procedures established by the commissioner of finance  making
      the  determination, that that address is the customer's place of primary
      use.
        c. Except as provided in subdivision b of this section, a home service
      provider may treat the address used by the  home  service  provider  for
      purposes  of  this  chapter for the last taxable period beginning before
      August first, two  thousand  two,  for  any  customer  under  a  service
      contract  or agreement in effect on July twenty-eighth, two thousand two
      as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term  of  such
      service  contract  or  agreement,  excluding any extension or renewal of
      such service contract or agreement.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1120
---------------

Section 11-1120 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1120  Assignment  of  place of primary use of telecommunications
      services  to  the  city.  a.  If  an  electronic  database  meeting  the
      requirements  of subsection a of section 119 of title four of the United
      States Code is provided by the state of New York,  or  by  a  designated
      database  provider as defined in subsection three of section 124 of such
      title, and the requirements of subsection b of such section 119 are met,
      a home service provider shall use that database to determine whether the
      customer's place of primary use is within the territorial limits of  the
      city  and  shall  reflect  changes  to  such database in accordance with
      subsection c of such section 119.
        b. A home service provider using the data contained in  an  electronic
      database  described  in  subdivision  a  of  this  section shall be held
      harmless from any tax liability that otherwise would be due  under  this
      chapter  solely  as  a  result of any error or omission in such database
      provided the home service provider has  properly  reflected  changes  to
      such  database  in  accordance with subsection c of section 119 of title
      four of the United States Code.
        c.  (1)  If  no  electronic  database  is  provided  as  described  in
      subdivision  a  of  this  section, a home service provider shall be held
      harmless from any tax liability under this chapter that otherwise  would
      be  due  solely  as  a result of an assignment of a street address to an
      incorrect taxing jurisdiction if,  subject  to  subdivision  d  of  this
      section,  the  home  service  provider  employs  an enhanced zip code to
      assign each street address to a specific taxing  jurisdiction  for  each
      level  of  taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level
      of taxing jurisdiction to  ensure  that  each  such  street  address  is
      assigned  to  the  correct  taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code
      overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the  home
      service  provider  must  designate one specific jurisdiction within such
      enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such  enhanced  zip
      code  for  each  level  of  taxing  jurisdiction.  Any enhanced zip code
      assignment changed in accordance with subdivision d of this  section  is
      deemed  to  be in compliance with this subdivision. For purposes of this
      subdivision, there is a  rebuttable  presumption  that  a  home  service
      provider  has  exercised  due  diligence  if  such home service provider
      demonstrates that it has:
        (i)  expended  reasonable  resources  to  implement  and  maintain  an
      appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments
      to taxing jurisdictions;
        (ii)  implemented  and  maintained  reasonable  internal  controls  to
      promptly  correct  misassignments  of   street   addresses   to   taxing
      jurisdictions; and
        (iii)  used  all  reasonably  obtainable and usable data pertaining to
      municipal annexations, incorporations,  reorganizations  and  any  other
      changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy
      of such database.
        (2)  Paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  applies  to a home service
      provider that is in compliance with the requirements of  such  paragraph
      until the later of:
        (i)  eighteen  months  after  the  nationwide  standard  numeric  code
      described in subsection (a) of section 119 of title four of  the  United
      States  Code  has  been approved by the federation of tax administrators
      and the multistate tax commission; or
        (ii) six months after the state of New York or a  designated  database
      provider  provides  a  database  as  prescribed in subdivision a of this
      section.
        d. The commissioner of finance, or the commissioner  of  taxation  and
      finance  of  the  state  of  New  York  on behalf of the commissioner of
    
      finance, may determine that the assignment of  a  street  address  to  a
      taxing  jurisdiction  by  a home service provider under subdivision c of
      this section does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction  and  give
      binding  notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on
      a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination if:
        (1) where the determination is made by the  commissioner  of  finance,
      such   commissioner   obtains   the   consent  of  all  affected  taxing
      jurisdictions  within  this  state  before   giving   such   notice   of
      determination; and
        (2)  the  home service provider is given an opportunity to demonstrate
      in accordance with applicable procedures established by the commissioner
      of finance making the determination that  the  assignment  reflects  the
      correct taxing jurisdiction.
