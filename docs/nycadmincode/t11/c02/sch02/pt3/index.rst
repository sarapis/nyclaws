        § 11-249 Functions, powers and duties of the board; annual designation
      of exemption areas and restricted commercial uses. a. The members of the
      board shall have the following functions, powers and duties:
        1.  to receive and review applications for certificates of eligibility
      pursuant to the charter and pursuant to subdivision thirteen of  section
      11-604 and subdivision (e) of section 11-503 of this title;
        2.  to  make  findings  and  determinations  on  the qualifications of
      applicants for certificates of eligibility pursuant  to  this  part  and
      pursuant  to  subdivision thirteen of section 11-658 and subdivision (e)
      of section 11-503 of this title;
        3. to issue certificates of eligibility and amendments thereto;
        4. to make recommendations to the tax commission on the termination of
      a tax exemption pursuant to section 11-253 of this part;
        5. to designate annually, pursuant to subdivision b of  this  section,
      areas  in which exemptions for commercial construction or reconstruction
      shall be granted as of right, areas from which such exemptions shall  be
      excluded  and commercial uses for which the granting of exemptions shall
      be restricted; and
        6. to make and promulgate rules  and  regulations  to  carry  out  the
      purposes of the board.
        b.  (1)  Not  later  than  October  first of each year the board shall
      publish a notice at least once in the official paper or a  newspaper  of
      general  circulation  in  the  city  setting  forth:  (i)  the  proposed
      boundaries of areas in which commercial construction  or  reconstruction
      shall  be  granted  exemptions as of right, proposed boundaries of areas
      from which exemptions  for  commercial  construction  or  reconstruction
      shall  be excluded and proposed restricted commercial uses; and (ii) the
      date, not earlier than ten nor later  than  thirty  days  following  the
      publication  of  such  notice,  on  which  the  board will hold a public
      hearing to hear all  persons  interested  in  the  designation  of  such
      boundaries and restricted commercial uses.
        (2)  Not  earlier  than  ten  nor later than thirty days following the
      conclusion of the public hearing provided for in paragraph one  of  this
      subdivision,  the board shall designate the boundaries of areas in which
      exemptions  for  commercial  construction  or  reconstruction  shall  be
      granted  as  of  right  and  areas  from  which such exemptions shall be
      excluded and shall  also  designate  restricted  commercial  uses.  Such
      designations shall be made upon the following determinations:
        (i)   With   respect  to  areas  in  which  exemption  for  commercial
      construction or reconstruction shall be granted as of right,  the  board
      shall  determine  that  market  conditions  in  each  area are such that
      exemptions  are  required  to   attract   commercial   construction   or
      reconstruction  to  the  area  and  that attracting such construction or
      reconstruction, and the granting of  exemptions  therefor,  are  in  the
      public  interest.  In making such determination, the board may consider,
      among other factors, that the area is experiencing economic distress  or
      is  characterized by an unusually large number of vacant, underutilized,
      unsuitable  or  substandard  structures,  or   by   other   substandard,
      unsanitary,  deteriorated  or  deteriorating conditions, with or without
      tangible blight, or that commercial development  in  the  area  will  be
      beneficial to the city's economy.
        (ii)  With  respect  to  areas  from  which  exemptions for commercial
      construction or reconstruction are  to  be  excluded,  the  board  shall
      determine  that  market conditions in each area are such that exemptions
      are not required to attract commercial construction or reconstruction to
      the area, or that it is not in the public interest to  grant  exemptions
      for   commercial   construction   or  reconstruction  in  the  area.  No
    
      applications   for   exemptions   for   commercial    construction    or
      reconstruction shall be accepted from such areas.
        (iii)  With  respect  to  restricted  commercial uses, the board shall
      determine that it is not in the public interest to grant exemptions  for
      such  uses  unless  the  board  further determines that in certain areas
      designated  pursuant  to  this  subdivision,  such  uses  will  have  an
      especially  positive  impact on the area's economy. All applications for
      exemptions for restricted commercial uses shall be  determined  pursuant
      to  paragraphs  two and three of subdivision b of section 11-251 of this
      part.
        (3) Designations made pursuant to this subdivision shall be  effective
      on the first day of January of each year.
        c. So far as practicable and subject to the approval of the mayor, the
      services  of  all  other  city  departments  and  agencies shall be made
      available by their respective heads to the board for the carrying out of
      the functions stated in this part. The head of any department or  agency
      shall furnish information in the possession of such department or agency
      when the board, after consultation with the mayor, so requests.

Section 11-250 ::    
        
     
        §  11-250    Real  property  tax exemption.   a.   A real property tax
      exemption pursuant to this part shall be granted to  an  applicant  who,
      within a period of thirty-six months, or following an extension pursuant
      to  section  11-254  of this part within a period of forty-eight months,
      from the date of issuance of a certificate of eligibility has  completed

        (1)    In  the  case  of  an  applicant  who  has completed industrial
      construction or reconstruction work, or commercial  reconstruction  work
      designated  as  of  right  pursuant to section 11-249 of this part or as
      specially needed pursuant to  section  11-251  of  this  part,  the  tax
      exemption  shall continue for nineteen tax years in an amount decreasing
      by five per centum each year from an exemption of ninety-five per centum
      of the exemption base, as defined in paragraph four of this subdivision.
        (2)  In the case of an applicant who has  completed  other  commercial
      reconstruction  work,  or new commercial construction work designated as
      of right pursuant to section 11-249 of this part or as specially  needed
      pursuant  to  section  11-251  of  this  part,  the  tax exemption shall
      continue for ten tax years, in an amount decreasing by five  per  centum
      each year from an exemption of fifty per centum of the exemption base.
        (3)    In  the  case  of  an  applicant  who  has  completed other new
      commercial construction work, the exemption shall continue for five  tax
      years  in  an  amount  decreasing  by  ten  per centum each year from an
      exemption of fifty per centum of the exemption base.
        (4)  The term "exemption base" shall mean the difference  between  the
      final  assessed  value  of the property as determined upon completion of
      the construction or reconstruction  work  and  the  lesser  of  (i)  the
      assessed   value  of  the  property  at  the  time  an  application  for
      certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part is made,  or  (ii)  the
      assessed  value  as may thereafter be reduced pursuant to application to
      the tax commission.
        The tax exemption shall be computed according to the following tables:
     
             CONSTRUCTION OR RECONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES OR
            RECONSTRUCTION OF AS OF RIGHT OR SPECIALLY NEEDED COMMERCIAL

        b.    The  taxes  payable  during  the  period  from the issuance of a
      certificate of eligibility to the approval of the tax exemption pursuant
      to section 11-252 of this part shall be paid on the lesser of:
        (1)  the assessed value of the property at the time an application for
      a certificate of eligibility pursuant to this part is made, or
        (2) the assessed value  as  may  thereafter  be  reduced  pursuant  to
      application   to   the   tax  commission,  provided,  however,  that  if
      reconstruction or construction is not completed in accordance  with  the
      plans   approved   in  the  certificate  of  eligibility  including  any
      amendments thereto, taxes shall be  due  and  payable  retroactively  as
      otherwise required by law.
        c.    In  all cases where the board shall have issued a certificate of
      eligibility prior to January first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-two,  the
      exemption  percentage  shall  apply  to  any  subsequent increase in the
      assessed valuation of the property during the tenure of  the  exemption.
      Where  the  board  has  issued  a certificate of eligibility on or after
      January first, nineteen hundred  eighty-two,  the  exemption  percentage
    
      shall  apply to any subsequent increase in the assessed valuation of the
      property during the first two years after approval of the tax  exemption
      pursuant  to  section  11-252  of  this part. Commencing two years after
      approval  of  the tax exemption pursuant to section 11-252 of this part,
      the exemption percentage shall  apply  to  any  subsequent  increase  in
      assessed  valuation  of the property only to the extent such increase is
      attributable to the construction or reconstruction work approved in  the
      certificate of eligibility.
        d.    The  provisions  of this part shall not apply to any increase in
      assessed value resulting from the construction or  reconstruction  of  a
      residential  structure  on any property receiving an exemption under the
      provisions of this part.   The  provisions  of  this  part  shall  apply
      exclusively to those structures and the lands underlying them which were
      identified explicitly in the certificate of eligibility.
        e.    The  provisions  of  this  part  shall  not  apply if any new or
      rehabilitated construction displaces or replaces a building or buildings
      containing more than twenty-five occupied dwelling units in existence on
      the date an application for certificate of eligibility is submitted  for
      preliminary  approval pursuant to section 11-251 of this part, which are
      administered under the local emergency housing  rent  control  act,  the
      rent  stabilization  law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine or the emergency
      tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, unless a certificate  of
      eviction  has  been  issued  for  any of the displaced or replaced units
      pursuant to the powers granted by the city rent and rehabilitation law.
        f.  The provisions of this part shall not apply to  an  applicant  who
      has  commenced construction or reconstruction work prior to the granting
      of a certificate of eligibility except where applicant, having filed  an
      application   for   a   certificate  of  eligibility,  receives  written
      permission to commence from the board or its  designated  representative
      prior  to  the  granting of a certificate of eligibility.  Demolition of
      existing structures, site preparation limited  to  grading,  filling  or
      clearing,  or  the  curing  of  a safety or sanitary hazard shall not be
      deemed to be commencement of construction or reconstruction work.
        g.  Any property enjoying the benefits of a tax exemption approved  by
      the  board  shall  be  ineligible  for  any subsequent or additional tax
      exemption pursuant to the provisions of this part until  the  expiration
      of  the original exemption period or earlier termination of the existing
      exemption by action of the tax commission.

Section 11-251 ::    
        
     
        § 11-251 Applications for certificates of eligibility. a. Applications
      for  a  certificate  of  eligibility  pursuant  to  this  part  shall be
      submitted  for  preliminary  approval  to  the   office   for   economic
      development  commencing  immediately after March first, nineteen hundred
      eighty-two  and  continuing  until  the  thirty-first  day  of  January,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-six,  on  such  form  or  forms  as  shall  be
      prescribed by the board. In addition to any other  information  required
      by  the board, the application shall include plans for reconstruction or
      construction that have been certified by a professional engineer  or  an
      architect  of  the applicant's choice and cost estimates or bids for the
      proposed reconstruction or construction. Upon a finding by  such  office
      that  the  application  satisfies  the requirements of reconstruction or
      construction as defined in this part, the application shall be presented
      to the board for evaluation and written notice thereof shall be given to
      the community board of the district in which  the  application  site  is
      located.
        b.   (1)   In   the   case  of  an  application  for  construction  or
      reconstruction of an industrial  structure  or  a  commercial  structure
      located  in  an  area  designated  as  of right, the board shall issue a
      certificate  of  eligibility  upon  determining  that  the   application
      satisfies  the requirements of construction or reconstruction as defined
      in this part, that the applicant has obtained plans for construction  or
      reconstruction  certified  by  a professional engineer or architect, and
      that the applicant has otherwise complied with the  provisions  of  this
      part and other applicable provisions of law.
        (2)  In  the case of an application for construction or reconstruction
      of a commercial structure not  located  in  an  as  of  right  area,  or
      involving   a  restricted  commercial  use,  the  board  shall  issue  a
      certificate of eligibility upon making the  determination  specified  in
      paragraph   one   of  this  subdivision  and  upon  making  the  further
      determination that the granting of a tax exemption for the  construction
      or reconstruction of such a structure in the proposed location is in the
      public  interest.  In  making  such  determination, the board shall make
      findings that there  is  a  need  in  the  area  for  the  services  the
      enterprise  will  provide,  that  the enterprise will generate or retain
      employment in the area, and that a tax incentive is required to  attract
      construction  or  reconstruction  of  such  a  structure to the area. In
      addition, the board shall consider the economic impact  such  commercial
      structure will have in the area.

      determination  that  special  circumstances  warrant   designating   the
      proposed construction or reconstruction as "specially needed". In making
      such  determination,  the  board shall make findings that the commercial
      services to be provided will have an especially positive impact  on  the
      area's  or  the  city's  economy and that the applicant has demonstrated
      that the project cannot go forward without the greater exemption granted
      by such designation.

      of  eligibility  is  to  be  considered shall be open to the public, and
      notice of such meeting shall be given at least two weeks  prior  thereto
      by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the city.
        d.  The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by clear and
      convincing evidence that the requirements for granting a  tax  exemption
      pursuant  to this part have been satisfied, and the board shall have the
      authority to require  that  statements  made  in  consideration  of  the
      application be taken under oath.
    
        e.  After  the  issuance of a certificate of eligibility the applicant
      shall apply to the city tax commission, during the  period  provided  by
      law  for filing applications for corrections of assessed valuations, for
      a tax exemption as provided for in section  11-250  of  this  part.  The
      application  shall  be  accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the certificate of
