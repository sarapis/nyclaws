Section 11-2502 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2502 Imposition of tax. a. (1) On and after July first, nineteen
      hundred  seventy  until  and  including  August  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty,  there  is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax
      for every occupancy of each room in a hotel in the city of New  York  at
      the  rates set forth in, and determined in accordance with the following
      table:
     
      If the rent per day for the room is:                   The tax is:
      Less than $10                                          $.25 per day
      $10 or more, but less than $15                         .50 per day
      $15 or more, but less than $20                         .75 per day
      $20 or more                                            1.00 per day
     
        (2) On and after September first, nineteen hundred  eighty,  there  is
      hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax for every occupancy of each
      room  in  a hotel in the city of New York at the rates set forth in, and
      determined in accordance with, the following table:
     
      If the rent per day for the room is:                   The tax is:
      $10 or more, but less than $20                         $.50 per day
      $20 or more, but less than $30                         $1.00 per day

      $40 or more                                            $2.00 per day
     
      Where a person occupies a room for less than a full day  and  pays  less
      than  the  rent  for  a full day, the tax shall nevertheless be the same
      amount as would be due had such person occupied the room for a full  day
      at the rent for a full day.
        (3)  In  addition  to  the  tax  imposed  by  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a  tax  for
      every  occupancy  of each room in a hotel in the city of New York (A) at
      the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per  day  for  each  such
      room  up  to and including August thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety,
      (B) at the rate of six percent of the rent or charge per  day  for  each
      such  room  on  and  after  September first, nineteen hundred ninety and
      before December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, (C) at the rate  of
      five  percent  of  the  rent or charge per day for each such room on and
      after December first, nineteen  hundred  ninety-four  and  before  March
      first,  two  thousand  nine,  (D)  at the rate of five and seven-eighths
      percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room  on  and  after
      March  first,  two thousand nine and before December first, two thousand
      thirteen, and (E) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge  per
      day  for  each  such  room  on  and  after  December first, two thousand
      thirteen.
        (4) (i) When occupancy is provided, for a single  consideration,  with
      property,  services, amusement charges, or any other items, the separate
      sale of which is not subject to  tax  under  this  chapter,  the  entire
      consideration  shall  be  treated as rent subject to tax under paragraph
      one of this subdivision; provided, however, that where the amount of the
      rent for occupancy is stated separately from the price of such property,
      services, amusement charges or other items on any sales  slip,  invoice,
      receipt,  or  other  statement  given  the  occupant  and  such  rent is
      reasonable  in  relation  to  the  value  of  such  property,  services,
      amusement charges, or other items, only such separately stated rent will
      be subject to tax under this subdivision.
        (ii) In regard to the collection of tax on occupancies by remarketers,
      when  occupancy  is provided, for a single consideration, with property,
      services, amusement charges, or any other items,  whether  or  not  such
    
      other  items are taxable, the rent portion of the consideration for such
      sale shall be computed as follows: the total consideration for the  sale
      multiplied   by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  shall  be  the
      consideration paid to the hotel for the occupancy and the denominator of
      which  shall  be  the  consideration paid to the hotel for the occupancy
      plus the consideration paid to the providers of the  other  items  being
      sold,  or  by  any  other  reasonable  method pursuant to which the rent
      portion of consideration would be no less than the computation  of  rent
      portion  of  consideration  under  subparagraph  (i)  of this paragraph.
      Nothing herein shall be construed to subject to tax or exempt  from  tax
      any  service  or  property  or amusement charge or other items otherwise
      subject to tax or exempt from tax under this chapter.
        (5) A room remarketer shall be allowed a refund or credit against  the
      taxes  collected and required to be remitted pursuant to section 11-2505
      of this chapter in the amount of the tax it paid to the operator of  the
      hotel  or  another  room  remarketer  under  this subdivision. Provided,
      however, that in order to qualify for a  refund  or  credit  under  this
      paragraph  with  respect  to  any  quarterly  period,  as  described  in
      subdivision a of section 11-2504 of this chapter,  the  room  remarketer
      must,  with  respect  to  such quarter, (i) be registered for hotel room
      occupancy tax purposes under section 11-2514 of this chapter,  and  (ii)
      collect   the  taxes  imposed  by  paragraphs  two  and  three  of  this
      subdivision.  Subject  to  the  conditions  and  limitations   of   this
      paragraph, the provisions of section 11-2507 of this chapter shall apply
      to refunds or credits under this paragraph.
        (6)  Where  the  rent  is  paid  or charged or billed, or falls due on
      either a weekly, monthly or other term basis, the daily rent upon  which
      the  tax is determined shall be the result obtained by dividing the rent
      for such term by the number of days in such term. Where the rent is  for
      more  than  one room, including but not limited to a suite of rooms, the
      daily rent per room upon which tax is determined shall be calculated  by
      multiplying  the  daily  rent  for the group of rooms by a fraction, the
      numerator of which shall be the daily rent for the particular room, or a
      similar  room,  when  such  room  is  rented  alone  with  similar  bath
      facilities, and the denominator of which shall be the total of the daily
      rent  for  the individual rooms in the group of rooms, or similar rooms,
      when such rooms are rented alone with similar bath  facilities.  In  any
      case in which it is not possible to determine the daily rent per room in
      the  foregoing  manner,  the  commissioner  of  finance  shall prescribe
      methods for making such determination.
        b. (1) No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon a permanent resident.
        (2) For purposes of this subdivision, an occupant who is  eligible  to
      request  and  has  requested  a  lease  pursuant  to  the  provisions of
      paragraph  two  of  subdivision  (a)  of  section  2522.5  of  the  rent
      stabilization  regulations  promulgated  by  the division of housing and
      community renewal of the state of New  York  (title  nine,  subtitle  S,
      chapter VIII of the official compilation of codes, rules and regulations
      of  the  state of New York), shall tentatively be accorded the status of
      permanent resident as of the date of such request, notwithstanding  that
      such  occupant  has  not  met  the  one  hundred  eighty-consecutive-day
      requirement contained in subdivision eight of section  11-2501  of  this
      chapter  as  of such date. In the case of such an occupant, the operator
      or room remarketer shall not collect the taxes imposed by  this  chapter
      for  any  day,  commencing  with the date such lease is requested, which
      falls within a period of continuous occupancy by such occupant of a room
      or rooms in the hotel. Provided, however, if  such  occupant  ceases  to
      occupy  a  room  or  rooms  in  the hotel prior to the completion of one
      hundred eighty consecutive days of occupancy, any  taxes  not  collected
    
      theretofore  by  reason of the provisions of this paragraph shall become
      immediately due and payable on the date of cessation  of  occupancy  and
      shall  be  collected  by  the  operator  or  room  remarketer  from such
      occupant. In the event, however, that the operator or room remarketer is
      unable  to  collect  such  taxes from the occupant, the operator or room
      remarketer shall  not  be  liable  to  the  city  for  such  taxes.  The
      provisions  of  this  paragraph  shall  apply  with  respect  to  leases
      requested on or after September first, nineteen hundred ninety.
        c. No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon any  organization  described
      in  subdivision  (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen of the tax law to
      the extent such organization is not subject to  the  tax  imposed  under
      subdivision (e) of section eleven hundred five of the tax law.
        d. (1) No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon any person occupying any
      room  or  rooms  in  a  hotel  solely  and  directly as a result of such
      person's involuntary displacement from premises by  the  attack  on  the
      World  Trade  Center  on  September eleventh, two thousand one, provided
      such premises were not subject to the tax imposed by this section or the
      tax imposed under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law.
        (2) Where  an  occupant  claims  exemption  from  the  tax  under  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision, the rent shall be
      deemed taxable hereunder unless the  operator  shall  receive  from  the
      occupant  claiming  such exemption a signed written statement describing
      the specific circumstances  providing  the  basis  for  such  claim  and
      containing  such  other  information  as the commissioner of finance may
      require. The operator shall retain such statement and provide it to  the
      commissioner of finance upon request.
        e.  Where  any  corporation,  or  association,  or trust, or community
      chest, fund  or  foundation,  organized  and  operated  exclusively  for
      religious, charitable, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of
      cruelty to children or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which
      inures  to  the  benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no
      substantial part of the activities of which is carrying  on  propaganda,
      or  otherwise  attempting  to  influence  legislation,  carries  on  its
      activities in furtherance of any  of  the  purposes  for  which  it  was
      organized, in premises in which, as part of said activities, it operates
      a  hotel,  occupancy  of  rooms  in  said  premises  and rents therefrom
      received by such corporation or association shall not be subject to  tax
      hereunder.    Nothing  in this subdivision shall be deemed to include an
      organization operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade  or
      business  for  profit,  whether or not all of its profits are payable to
      one or more organizations described in this subdivision.
        f. The tax to be collected shall be stated separately from the rent on
      a sales  slip,  invoice,  receipt,  or  other  statement  of  the  price
      ("invoice")  given to the occupant prior to the occupant's completion of
      his or her occupancy and be verifiable from the books and records of  an
      operator or room remarketer responsible for collecting and remitting the
      tax.
        (1)  Where an occupant rents a room directly from an operator, the tax
      shall be paid by the occupant to the operator  as  trustee  for  and  on
      account of the city, and the operator shall be liable for the collection
      of the tax on the rent and for the payment of the tax on the rent.
        (2)  The  operator or room remarketer and any officer of any corporate
      operator or room remarketer shall be personally liable for  the  portion
      of the tax collected or required to be collected under this chapter, and
      the  operator shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax
      from the occupant, or in  respect  to  nonpayment  of  the  tax  by  the
      occupant as if the tax were a part of the rent for the occupancy payable
      at the time such tax shall become due and owing, including all rights of
    
      eviction, dispossession, repossession and enforcement of any innkeeper's
      lien  that  he or she may have in the event of nonpayment of rent by the
      occupant; provided however, that the commissioner of  finance  shall  be
      joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought by the operator to
      collect or enforce collection of the tax.
        g.  Where  the  occupant  has  failed  to pay and the operator or room
      remarketer has failed to collect a tax as imposed by this chapter,  then
      in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, such
      tax  shall  be  payable  by the occupant directly to the commissioner of
      finance, and it shall be the duty of  the  occupant  to  file  a  return
      thereof  with  the  commissioner  of  finance and to pay the tax imposed
      therein to the commissioner of finance within fifteen  days  after  such
      tax was due.
        h.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may,  wherever  he or she deems it
      necessary for  the  proper  enforcement  of  this  chapter,  provide  by
      regulation  that the occupant shall file returns and pay directly to the
      commissioner of finance the tax herein imposed, at such times as returns
      are required to be filed and payment over made by the operator  or  room
      remarketer.
        i. The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid upon any occupancy on
      and  after July first, nineteen hundred seventy, although such occupancy
      is had pursuant to a contract, lease or other arrangement made prior  to
      such  effective date. Where rent is paid, or charged or billed, or falls
      due on either a weekly, monthly, or other term basis, the rent so  paid,
      charged,  billed  or  falling  due  shall  be  subject to the tax herein
      imposed to the extent that it covers any portion of the  period  on  and
      after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy, and such payment, bill,
      charge or rent due shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of the
      number of days falling within said period, to the total number  of  days
      covered  thereby.  Where  any  tax has been paid hereunder upon any rent
      which has been ascertained to be worthless, the commissioner of  finance
      may by regulation provide for credit and/or refund of the amount of such
      tax  upon  application  therefor  as provided in section 11-2507 of this
      chapter.
        j. For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
      prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all
      rents are subject to tax until the  contrary  is  established,  and  the
      burden  of  proving  that  a rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder
      shall be upon the operator, the room remarketer, or the occupant.  Where
      an  occupant  claims  exemption  from  the  tax  under the provisions of
      subdivision c  of  this  section,  the  rent  shall  be  deemed  taxable
      hereunder  unless the operator or room remarketer shall receive from the
      occupant claiming such exemption  a  copy  of  the  exempt  organization
      certificate  that  is necessary to obtain exemption from the tax imposed
      under subdivision (e) of section eleven hundred five  of  the  tax  law,
      together  with  a certificate duly executed by the organization named in
      such  certificate  certifying  that   the   occupant   is   its   agent,
      representative  or  employee and that his or her occupancy is paid or to
      be paid by, and is  necessary  or  required  in  the  course  of  or  in
      connection with the affairs of said organization.
        k.  No  operator or room remarketer shall advertise or hold out to the
      public in any manner, directly or indirectly, that the  tax  imposed  by
      this  chapter  is  not  considered  as  a mandatory addition to the rent
      charged to the occupant.

Section 11-2503 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2503  Records  to  be  kept.  a.  Every  operator and every room
      remarketer shall keep records of every occupancy and of all  rent  paid,
      charged  or  due thereon and of the tax payable thereon, in such form as
      the commissioner of finance may  by  regulation  require.  Such  records
      shall  be  available  for  inspection  and  examination at any time upon
      demand by the commissioner of finance or  his  or  her  duly  authorized
      agent  or  employee  and shall be preserved for a period of three years,
      except that the commissioner of finance may consent to their destruction
      within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
        b. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three  hundred  five  and
      three  hundred  nine  of  the state technology law or any other law, the
      commissioner may require any person who has elected to  maintain  in  an
      electronic  format  any portion of the records required to be maintained
      by that person under  this  chapter,  to  make  the  electronic  records
      available  and  accessible to the commissioner, notwithstanding that the
      records are also maintained in a hard copy format.

---------------

Section 11-2504 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2504  Returns. a. Every operator and every room remarketer shall
      file with the commissioner of finance  a  return  of  occupancy  and  of
      rents,  and  of  the  taxes  payable  thereon, for the quarterly periods
      ending on the last day of February, May, August  and  November  of  each
      year.  Such  returns  shall be filed within twenty days after the end of
      the quarterly period covered thereby. The commissioner  of  finance  may
      permit  or  require  returns  to  be made by other periods and upon such
      dates as he or she may specify. If the commissioner of finance deems  it
      necessary  in  order  to  insure  the payment of the tax imposed by this
      chapter, he or she may require returns to be made  for  shorter  periods
      than  those  prescribed  pursuant  to  the  foregoing provisions of this
      subdivision and upon such dates as he or she may specify.
        b. The forms of returns shall be prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance  and  shall  contain  such  information  as  he  or she may deem
      necessary  for  the  proper  administration   of   this   chapter.   The
      commissioner  of  finance may require amended returns to be filed within
      twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the
      notice.
        c. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or  if  a  return
      when  filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face the commissioner of
      finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of  such  a
      return or a corrected return.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2505
---------------

Section 11-2505 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2505 Payment of tax. At the time of filing a return of occupancy
      and of rents  each  operator  and  room  remarketer  shall  pay  to  the
      commissioner of finance the taxes imposed by this chapter upon the rents
      required  to  be  included  in  such return, as well as all other moneys
      collected by the operator or room remarketer acting or purporting to act
      under the provisions of this  chapter,  even  though  it  be  judicially
      determined  that  the  tax collected is invalidly imposed. All the taxes
      for the period for which a return is required to be filed shall  be  due
      from  the operator or room remarketer and payable to the commissioner of
      finance on the date limited for  the  filing  of  the  return  for  such
      period,  without  regard  to  whether  a  return is filed or whether the
      return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and the  taxes
      due  thereon. Where the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion
      deems it necessary to protect revenues to be obtained under this chapter
      he or she may require  any  operator  or  room  remarketer  required  to
      collect  the tax imposed by this chapter to file with him or her a bond,
      issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state
      and approved by the superintendent of insurance  of  this  state  as  to
      solvency  and  responsibility,  in  such  amount  as the commissioner of
      finance may fix, to secure the payment of any tax and/or  penalties  and
      interest  due  or  which  may  become  due  from  such  operator or room
      remarketer. In the event that the  commissioner  of  finance  determines
      that an operator or room remarketer is to file such bond he or she shall
      give  notice  to  such  operator  or  room  remarketer  to  that  effect
      specifying the amount  of  the  bond  required.  The  operator  or  room
      remarketer  shall  file  such  bond within five days after the giving of
      such notice unless within such five days the operator or room remarketer
      shall request in writing a hearing before the commissioner of finance at
      which  the  necessity,  propriety  and  amount  of  the  bond  shall  be
      determined  by  the commissioner of finance. Such determination shall be
      final and shall be complied with within fifteen days after the giving of
      notice thereof. In  lieu  of  such  bond,  securities  approved  by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  or  cash  in  such  amount  as  he or she may
      prescribe, may be deposited which shall be kept in the  custody  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance  who  may  at  any  time without notice to the
      depositor apply them to any tax and/or interest or  penalties  due,  and
      for  that  purpose the securities may be sold by him or her at public or
      private sale without notice to the depositor thereof.

Section 11-2506 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2506  Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter
      is not filed, or if a return when filed is  incorrect  or  insufficient,
      the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance
      from  such  information  as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax
      may be estimated on the basis of external indices,  such  as  number  of
      rooms,   location,   scale   of   rents,   comparable   rents,  type  of
      accommodations and service, number of employees  and/or  other  factors.
      Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the
      collection  and/or  payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally
      and irrevocably fix the  tax  unless  the  person  against  whom  it  is
      assessed,   within   ninety   days   after  giving  of  notice  of  such
      determination, or, if the commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a
      conciliation  procedure  pursuant  to section 11-124 of the code and the
      taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation   conference   in   accordance
      therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a conciliation
      decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of   the
      discontinuance  of  the  conciliation  proceeding,  both  (1)  serves  a
      petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition  with
      the  tax  appeals  tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of
      finance of his or her  own  motion  shall  redetermine  the  same.  Such
      hearing  and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from
      the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in  the  manner
      and  subject  to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal
      pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one  hundred
      seventy-two  of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal
      shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax  is
      assessed.  A  decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall
      be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any  other
      reason  whatsoever  by  a  proceeding under article seventy-eight of the
      civil practice law and rules if application  therefor  is  made  to  the
      supreme  court  by  the person against whom the tax was assessed, within
      four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals  tribunal
      decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
      law  and  rules  shall  not be instituted by a person liable for the tax
      unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with  penalties
      and  interest  thereon,  if  any,  shall  be  first  deposited  with the
      commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with  the  commissioner
      of  finance  an  undertaking,  issued  by a surety company authorized to
      transact business in this state and approved by  the  superintendent  of
      insurance  of  this  state  as  to  solvency and responsibility, in such
      amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve,  to  the  effect
      that  if  such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person
      will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in  the  prosecution  of
      the  proceeding;  or  (b)  at the option of such person such undertaking
      filed with the commissioner of finance may be in  a  sum  sufficient  to
      cover  the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision
      plus  the  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  against  it  in  the
      prosecution  of  the proceeding, in which event such person shall not be
      required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest  as  a  condition
      precedent to the application.

---------------

Section 11-2507 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2507  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid if written application to the commissioner of  finance
      for  such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof.
      Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied  by  the  commissioner  of
      finance,  he  or  she  shall  state his or her reasons therefor and give
      notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. Such application may be  made
      by  the  occupant,  operator,  room  remarketer  or other person who has
      actually paid the tax to the commissioner of finance.  Such  application
      may also be made by an operator or room remarketer who has collected and
      paid  over  such  tax  to  the commissioner of finance provided that the
      application is made within one year of the payment by  the  occupant  to
      the operator or room remarketer, but no actual refund of moneys shall be
      made  to  such  operator  or room remarketer until he or she shall first
      establish to the satisfaction of the commissioner of finance, under such
      regulations as the commissioner of finance may prescribe, that he or she
      has repaid to the occupant the amount  for  which  the  application  for
      refund  is  made. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund
      required to be made, allow credit therefor  on  payments  due  from  the
      applicant.
        b.  Any  determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund
      or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  final  and
      irrevocable  unless  the  applicant  for  such  refund or credit, within
      ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation   procedure
      pursuant   to   section   11-124  and  the  applicant  has  requested  a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition  for
      a  refund  or  credit,  made  as  herein  provided,  shall  be deemed an
      application for a revision of any tax, penalty  or  interest  complained
      of.  Such  hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through one
      hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall  give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the
      commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review  such
      decision  of  the  tax  appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding
      pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules,
      provided  such  proceeding  is  instituted  within four months after the
      giving of the notice of such decision, and provided, in the case  of  an
      application  by  a person liable for the tax, that a final determination
      of tax  was  not  previously  made.  Such  a  proceeding  shall  not  be
      instituted by a person liable for the tax unless an undertaking is filed
      with  the  commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties
      as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the  effect  that  if
      such  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay
      all costs and charges which  may  accrue  in  the  prosecution  of  such
      proceeding.
        c.  A  person  shall  not  be entitled to a revision, refund or credit
      under this section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which  had  been
      determined  to  be  due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2506 of
      this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity  for  a
      hearing,  as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or
    
      herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit  shall  be
      made  of  a  tax,  interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
      commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-2506 of this chapter
      unless  it  be  found  that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
      unconstitutional or otherwise improper,  by  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      after  a  hearing or of the commissioner of finance's own motion, or, if
      such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the  determination
      of   the   commissioner  of  finance,  in  a  proceeding  under  article
      seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and  rules,  pursuant  to  the
      provision  of  said  section,  in  which  event refund or credit without
      interest shall be made of the tax, interest or  penalty  found  to  have
      been overpaid.

        §  11-2508  Reserves.  In  cases  where the occupant, operator or room
      remarketer has applied for a refund  and  has  instituted  a  proceeding
      under  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice law and rules to
      review a determination  adverse  to  such  occupant,  operator  or  room
      remarketer  on  his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall
      set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.

        §  11-2509  Remedies  exclusive.  The  remedies  provided  by sections
      11-2506 and 11-2507 of this chapter  shall  be  the  exclusive  remedies
      available  to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this
      chapter; and no  determination  or  proposed  determination  of  tax  or
      determination  on  any  application  for  refund  by the commissioner of
      finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals  tribunal  or  any  of  its
      administrative  law  judges,  shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action
      for declaratory judgment, and action for money had and  received  or  by
      any  action  or  proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the
      tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the  nature  of  a
      certiorari  proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
      law and rules;  provided,  however,  that  a  taxpayer  may  proceed  by
      declaratory  judgment  if  he  or she institutes suit within thirty days
      after a deficiency assessment  is  made  and  pays  the  amount  of  the
      deficiency  assessment  to  the  commissioner  of  finance  prior to the
      institution of such suit and posts a  bond  for  costs  as  provided  in
      section 11-2506 of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-2510
---------------

Section 11-2510 ::    
        
     
        § 11-2510 Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any operator or room
      remarketer,  or  any officer of a corporate operator or room remarketer,
      or any occupant or other person shall fail to collect and pay  over  any
      tax  and/or  to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter
      as therein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request  of
      the  commissioner  of  finance bring or cause to be brought an action to
      enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any
      court of the state of New York or of any other state or  of  the  United
      States.  If,  however,  the  commissioner  of  finance  in  his  or  her
      discretion believes that any such operator, or room remarketer, officer,
      occupant or other person is about to cease business, leave the state  or
      remove  or  dissipate  the  assets  out  of  which the tax, penalties or
      interest might be satisfied, and that any such tax, penalty or  interest
      will  not  be  paid when due, he or she may declare such tax, penalty or
      interest to be immediately due and  payable  and  may  issue  a  warrant
      immediately.
        b.  As  an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance
      may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him or  her
      to  levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the operator or
      room remarketer or officer of a corporate operator or room remarketer or
      of the occupant or other person liable for the tax, which may  be  found
      within  the  city  for  the  payment  of  the  amount  thereof, with any
      penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the  warrant,  and  to
      return  such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to him or
      her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty  days  after  the
      receipt  of  such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after
      the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk  a  copy  thereof,
      and  thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of
      the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties
      and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy
      is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall  become
      a  lien  upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of
      the person against whom the warrant is issued. The  city  sheriff  shall
      then proceed upon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect,
      as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property
      upon  judgments  of a court of record, and for services in executing the
      warrant such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she
      may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of
      finance a warrant of like terms, force and  effect  may  be  issued  and
      directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in
      the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers
      conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  from time to time issue new warrants and
      shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount  due  thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever an operator shall make a sale, transfer, or assignment in
      bulk of any part or the whole of such operator's hotel or of his or  her
      lease,  license  or  other agreement or right to possess or operate such
      hotel, or of the equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies or stock  of
      merchandise,  or  of  the  said  premises  or  lease,  license  or other
      agreement or right to possess or operate such hotel and  the  equipment,
      furnishings,  fixtures,  supplies and stock of merchandise pertaining to
      the conduct or operation of said hotel, otherwise than in  the  ordinary
      and  regular  prosecution  of  business,  the  purchaser,  transferee or
      assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of the subject
    
      of said sale, transfer or assignment, or  paying  therefor,  notify  the
      commissioner  of  finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of
      the price, terms and conditions  thereof  whether  or  not  the  seller,
      transferor  or  assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser,
      transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant  to  this  chapter,
      and  whether  or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge
      that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing.
        Whenever the purchaser, transferee or  assignee  shall  fail  to  give
      notice  to  the  commissioner  of  finance  as required by the preceding
      paragraph, or whenever the commissioner  of  finance  shall  inform  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or
      taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or  other
      consideration,  which  the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required
      to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be  subject
      to  a  first  priority  right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or
      thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or  assignor
      to  the  city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to
      transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums  of  money,
      property  or  choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's
      claim. For failure to comply with the provisions  of  this  subdivision,
      the  purchaser,  transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to
      the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six
      of the uniform commercial code,  shall  be  personally  liable  for  the
      payment  to  the  city  of  any  such  taxes  theretofore  or thereafter
      determined to be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller,  transferor  or
      assignor,  and  such  liability may be assessed and enforced in the same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of  this  section,  and  such  release or vacating of the warrant may be
      recorded in the office of any recording officer in  which  such  warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      herein otherwise provided. Such officers shall be the city  sheriff  and
      his  or  her duly appointed deputies or any officers or employees of the

        §  11-2514  Registration. By June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy,
      or in the case of operators or room remarketers commencing  business  or
      opening  new  hotels  after  such  date,  within  three  days after such
      commencement or opening, or  in  the  case  of  room  remarketers  doing

      issue without charge to each operator or room remarketer  a  certificate
      of  authority empowering such operator or room remarketer to collect the
      tax from the occupant and duplicate thereof for each additional hotel of
      such operator. Each certificate or duplicate shall state  the  hotel  or
      room  remarketer  to  which  it  is  applicable.  Such  certificates  of
      authority shall  be  prominently  displayed  by  the  operator  or  room
      remarketer  in such manner that it may be seen and come to the notice of
      all occupants and persons seeking occupancy. Such certificates shall  be
      non-assignable  and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately

Section 11-2515 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2515  Interest  and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If
      any amount of tax is not paid or paid over on or before  the  last  date
      prescribed  for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted
      for  payment),  interest  on  such  amount  at  the  rate  set  by   the
      commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or,
      if  no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum,
      shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment.
      In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest  shall  be
      compounded  daily.  Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if
      the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of  failure  to  file  a
      return  under  this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined
      with regard to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown
      that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
      neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as  tax
      on  such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is
      for not more than one month, with an additional five  percent  for  each
      additional   month   or  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall  not  be
      less  than  the  lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 75, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the  return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  a  determination  made  pursuant  to section 11-2506 of this
      chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice  and  demand  therefor,
      unless  it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such  tax  if  the
      failure  is  not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of
    
      one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof  during  which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month,  the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such paragraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 75, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 75, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (d)  Underpayment  due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal  to
      two times the underpayment.
        (3)  The  penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        (e) Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent,  shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify  any  return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within the time
      required by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of  not
      more  than  one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any other amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
      commissioner of finance. The commissioner  of  finance  shall  have  the
      power,  in  his  or  her  discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall  be  paid
      and  disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter.
      Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as  the
      tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g)  (1)  Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
    
      deemed to be set at seven and one-half  percent  per  annum.  Such  rate
      shall  be  the  rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but
      shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per  annum.  Any  such
      rate  set  by  the  commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any
      portion thereof, which remain or become due on  or  after  the  date  on
      which  such  rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to
      interest computed or computable  for  periods  or  portions  of  periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2)  General  rule.  The  rate  of interest set under this subdivision
      shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate  as  provided  under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A)  The  federal  short-term  rate for any month shall be the federal
      short-term rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  the
      treasury  during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section
      twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
      connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
      internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest
      full  percent  (or,  if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)  In  general.  Except  as  provided  in  clause   (ii)   of   this
      subparagraph,  the  federal  short-term rate for the first month in each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii) Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.  The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of April,
      nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with  respect  to  setting  the
      rate   of   interest  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner  of  finance  shall
      cause  to  be  published  in the city record, and give other appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later than twenty days preceding the first day of the  calendar  quarter
      during  which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of
      such interest rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph  (a)  of
      subdivision  five  of section one thousand forty-one of the city charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        (h) Miscellaneous. (1)  Officers  of  a  corporate  operator  or  room
      remarketer  and  partners  in a partnership which is an operator or room
      remarketer shall be personally liable for the tax collected or  required
      to  be  collected by such corporation or partnership under this chapter,
      and subject to the penalties and interest imposed by this section.
        (2) The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect  that
      a tax has not been paid, that a return, bond or registration certificate
      has  not  been filed, or that information has not been supplied pursuant
      to the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  shall  be  presumptive  evidence
      thereof.
        (3) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this
      title.
        (i) Any person required to make or maintain records under this chapter
      who  fails  to  make  or  maintain or make available to the commissioner
      these records is subject to a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars
      for the first quarterly period or part thereof  for  which  the  failure
      occurs  and  not  to  exceed  five  thousand dollars for each additional
      quarterly period or part thereof for  which  the  failure  occurs.  This
      penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided for in this chapter
      but may not be imposed and collected more than once for failures for the
    
      same  quarterly  period  or part thereof. If the commissioner determines
      that a failure to make or maintain or  make  available  records  in  any
      quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful
      neglect,  the  commissioner  must  remit  the  penalty  imposed for that
      quarterly period. These penalties will be paid and disposed  of  in  the
      same manner as other revenues from this chapter. These penalties will be
      determined, assessed, collected, paid and enforced in the same manner as
      the  tax imposed by this chapter, and all the provisions of this chapter
      relating to tax will be deemed also to apply to the penalties imposed by
      this  subdivision.  For  purposes  of  the  penalty  imposed   by   this
      subdivision,  a  person  will  be  considered  to have failed to make or
      maintain  the  required  records  when  the  commissioner   of   finance
      determines  that  the  records  made  or maintained by that person for a
      quarterly period do not enable the commissioner to verify  occupancy  or
      the  amounts  received  for  such  occupancy  or  the taxability of that
      occupancy and to conduct a complete audit.
        (j) Any person required to make or maintain records under this chapter
      who fails to present and make available these records  in  an  auditable
      form is subject to a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each
      quarterly  period  or  part thereof for which records maintained by that
      person are not presented and made available by that person in  auditable
      form,  even  if  these records are adequate to verify credits, receipts,
      and the taxability thereof and to perform a complete audit. This penalty
      is in addition to any other penalty provided for in  this  chapter,  but
      will  not be imposed and collected more than once for these failures for
      the  same  quarterly  period  or  part  thereof.  If  the   commissioner
      determines  that  any  failure  described  in  this  subdivision  for  a
      quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful
      neglect, the commissioner  must  remit  the  penalty  imposed  for  that
      quarter.  The  penalties  imposed  by  this subdivision will be paid and
      disposed of in the same manner as  other  revenues  from  this  chapter.
      These  penalties  will  be  determined,  assessed,  collected,  paid and
      enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter, and  all
      the  provisions  of  this chapter relating to tax will be deemed also to
      apply to the penalties imposed by this subdivision. For purposes of  the
      penalty imposed by this subdivision, a person will be considered to have
      failed  to present and make records available in auditable form when the
      records presented by  that  person  for  that  quarter  lack  sufficient
      organization,  such  as  by  date,  invoice  number,  sales receipts, or
      sequential numbering, or are otherwise inadequate (without reorganizing,
      reordering or otherwise rearranging the records into an auditable  form)
      to  permit  direct  reconciliation  of  the  receipts, invoices or other
      source documents with the entries for the quarterly period in the  books
      and records and on the returns of that person.
        (k) Any person who, having elected to maintain in an electronic format
      any  portion  or  all  of  the records he or she is required to make and
      maintain by this chapter,  fails  to  present  and  make  these  records
      available  and  accessible  to the commissioner in electronic format, is
      subject to a penalty not  to  exceed  five  thousand  dollars  for  each
      quarterly  period or part thereof for which these electronic records are
      not  presented  and  made  available  and   accessible   upon   request,
      notwithstanding that the records may also be maintained and available in
      hard  copy  format.  This  penalty  is  in addition to any other penalty
      provided for in this chapter, but may not be imposed and collected  more
      than  once  for a failure for the same quarterly period or part thereof.
      Provided, however, nothing in this subdivision will prevent the separate
      imposition, if applicable, of any penalty imposed by subdivision (i)  or
      (j)  of  this  section for the same quarterly period or part thereof. If
    
      the commissioner  determines  that  the  failure  to  present  and  make
      electronically   maintained  records  available  and  accessible  for  a
      quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful
      neglect,  the  commissioner  must  remit  the  penalty  imposed for that
      quarter. These penalties will be paid and disposed of in the same manner
      as other revenues from this chapter. These penalties will be determined,
      assessed, collected, paid and enforced in the same  manner  as  the  tax
      imposed by this chapter, and all the provisions of this chapter relating
      to  tax  will  be  deemed  also  to apply to the penalty imposed by this
      subdivision. For purposes of the penalty imposed by this subdivision,  a
      failure to present and make available and accessible a record maintained
      in  electronic  format  includes  not  only  the denial of access to the
      requested records that were  maintained  electronically,  but  also  the
      failure   to   make  available  to  the  commissioner  the  information,
      knowledge,  or  means  necessary  to  access  and  otherwise   use   the
      electronically  maintained  records in the inspection and examination of
      these records.
        (l) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns,  reports,
      statements  or other documents. Any person who, with the intent that tax
      be evaded, for a fee or other compensation or  as  an  incident  to  the
      performance   of   other   services   for  which  that  person  receives
      compensation, aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or advises  the
      preparation  or  presentation  under this chapter, or in connection with
      any  matter  arising  under  this  chapter,  of  any   return,   report,
      declaration,  statement or other document that is fraudulent or false as
      to any material matter, or supplies any false or fraudulent information,
      whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of
      the person authorized  or  required  to  present  that  return,  report,
      declaration,  statement  or  other  document,  will  pay  a  penalty not
      exceeding five thousand dollars. The definitions in  subsection  (l)  of
      section  one  thousand eighty-five of the tax law apply for the purposes
      of this penalty.
        (m) False or fraudulent document penalty. Any taxpayer that submits  a
      false  or  fraudulent  document  to  the department will be subject to a
      penalty of one hundred dollars per document submitted, or  five  hundred
      dollars  per  tax  return submitted. This penalty will be in addition to
      any other penalty provided by law.

      portion of any return is furnished, or to whom any information contained
      in any return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any  manner  the
      rents  or  other  information  relating  to  the  business of a taxpayer
      contained in any  return  required  under  this  chapter.  The  officers
      charged  with  the  custody  of  such  returns  shall not be required to
      produce any of them or evidence of anything contained  in  them  in  any
      action  or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner
      of finance in an action or  proceeding  under  the  provisions  of  this
      chapter  or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
      provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown  thereby  are
      directly  involved  in  such  action  or  proceeding, in either of which
      events the court may  require  the  production  of,  and  may  admit  in
      evidence,  so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are
      pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein  shall

      authorized representative of a certified copy of  any  return  filed  in
      connection  with  his or her tax; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a
      certified copy of such return or of  any  information  contained  in  or

      legal representatives of the city or by the  district  attorney  of  any
      county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so
      classified  as  to  prevent the identification of particular returns and

      destroyed.
        b. (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates  the

Section 11-2517 ::    
        
     
        § 11-2517 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by him or her pursuant to the provisions  of  this  chapter  or  in  any
      application  made  by  him  or  her  or,  if no return has been filed or
      application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
      of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the  same
      by  the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined
      according to the provisions of this chapter  by  the  giving  of  notice
      shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city  to  levy,
      appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the collection of any tax or
      penalty provided by this chapter. However,  except  in  the  case  of  a
      wilfully  false  or  fraudulent  return with intent to evade the tax, no
      assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of  more
      than  three  years  from  the  date of the filing of a return; provided,
      however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the  tax
      may be assessed at any time.
        c.  Where,  before  the expiration of the period prescribed herein for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
      be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
      extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d.  If  any  return,  claim,  statement, notice, application, or other
      document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
      within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  finance,
      the  tax  appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which
      or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to  which  or  to
      whom  such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States
      postmark stamped on the envelope shall be  deemed  to  be  the  date  of
      delivery.  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls
      within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the
      filing of such document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including  any
      extension  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document
      or  payment  was  deposited  in  the  mail,  postage  prepaid,  properly
      addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  finance, the tax appeals tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom  the  document
      is  required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required
      to be made. If any document is sent by United  States  registered  mail,
      such  registration  shall be prima facie evidence that such document was
      delivered to the commissioner of  finance,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,
      bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the
      date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner
      of  finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized
      to provide by regulation the extent  to  which  the  provisions  of  the
      preceding  sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and
      the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as  provided  in
      subdivision  f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case
      of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to
      the extent provided by regulation of the  commissioner  of  finance  or,
      where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.
    
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such
      act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding
      day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

Section 11-2519. ::    
        
     
        § 11-2519. Tourism and convention fund.--Notwithstanding any provision
      of  law  to  the contrary, with respect to the additional tax imposed at
      the rate of six percent on and after September first,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety  and before December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four pursuant
      to subparagraph (B) of paragraph  three  of  subdivision  a  of  section
      11-2502  of  this  chapter,  four  and  one-sixth  percent  of the total
      revenues resulting from the imposition of such tax, including  four  and
      one-sixth  percent  of  any  interest  or  penalties  thereon,  shall be
      credited to and deposited in a  special  tourism  and  convention  fund,
      which  shall  be  used  solely  for the purpose of promoting tourism and
      conventions in the city. Seven-eighths of the moneys in such fund  shall
      be  made available to the New York Convention and Visitor's Bureau, Inc.
      pursuant to an annual contract with the city which  may  specify,  among
      other  things,  the services which shall be provided by such bureau with
      such moneys and the content and number of reports which will have to  be
      provided  by  such bureau to the city concerning the expenditure of such
      moneys, and provided that the annual budget and business  plan  of  such
      bureau  is approved by the mayor of the city or his or her designee. The
      remaining one-eighth of the fund shall be spent  for  promoting  tourism
      and  conventions  which  may  include, at the mayor's discretion, moneys
      spent in connection with additional contracts made  with  the  New  York
      Convention  and Visitor's Bureau, Inc. For purposes of this section, the
      term "promoting tourism and conventions" shall mean developing,  placing
      and  purchasing  advertising  promoting  the  city, and engaging in such
      other efforts as are designed to attract tourists and conventions to the
      city.
