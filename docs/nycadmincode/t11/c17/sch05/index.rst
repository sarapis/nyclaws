===========================================

Section 11-1781
---------------

Section 11-1781 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1781 Notice of deficiency. (a) General. If upon examination of a
      taxpayer's return under this chapter the tax commission determines  that
      there  is a deficiency of income tax, it may mail a notice of deficiency
      to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer  fails  to  file  an  income  tax  return
      required  under  this  chapter,  the  tax  commission  is  authorized to
      estimate the taxpayer's city taxable income and tax  thereon,  from  any
      information in its possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the
      taxpayer.  A  notice  of  deficiency  shall  be  mailed  by certified or
      registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address  in  or
      out  of  this state. If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a
      notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except  that  if  the
      tax  commission  has  been  notified  by  either  spouse  that  separate
      residences have been established, then, in  lieu  of  the  single  joint
      notice, a duplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each
      spouse  at his or her last known address in or out of this state. If the
      taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency
      may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of this  state,
      unless  the  tax  commission  has  received notice of the existence of a
      fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.
        (b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. After  ninety  days  from  the
      mailing of a notice of deficiency, such notice shall be an assessment of
      the  amount of tax specified in such notice, together with the interest,
      additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice,  except  only  for
      any  such  tax or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has within such
      ninety day period filed with the tax commission a petition under section
      11-1789. If the notice of deficiency is addressed to a person outside of
      the United States, such period shall be one hundred fifty  days  instead
      of ninety days.
        (c) Restrictions on assessment and levy. No assessment of a deficiency
      in  tax  and  no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be
      made, begun or prosecuted,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  section
      11-1794,  until  a notice of deficiency has been mailed to the taxpayer,
      nor until the expiration of the time for filing  a  petition  contesting
      such  notice,  nor,  if  a petition with respect to the taxable year has
      been filed with the tax  commission,  until  the  decision  of  the  tax
      commission  has  become  final.  For  exception  in the case of judicial
      review of the decision of the tax commission,  see  subdivision  (c)  of
      section 11-1790.
        (d)  Exceptions  for  mathematical  errors.  If  a  mathematical error
      appears on a return (including an overstatement of the credit for income
      tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid  as  estimated  income
      tax), the tax commission shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax
      in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that such excess has
      been  assessed.  Such  notice  shall  not  be  considered as a notice of
      deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of  section
      11-1787   (limiting  credits  or  refunds  after  petition  to  the  tax
      commission), or subdivision (b)  of  section  11-1789  (authorizing  the
      filing  of  a  petition  with  the  tax  commission based on a notice of
      deficiency) nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the
      provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.
        (e) Exceptions where federal changes, corrections or disallowances are
      not reported. (1) If the taxpayer  or  employer  fails  to  comply  with
      section 11-1759, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for
      in  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section, the tax commission may assess a
      deficiency based upon such federal change, correction or disallowance by
      mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax  due  specifying  the
      amount  of  the  deficiency,  and  such  deficiency,  together  with the
      interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be
    
      deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless  within  thirty
      days  after  the  mailing of such notice a report of the federal change,
      correction or disallowance or an amended return, where such  return  was
      required by section 11-1759, is filed accompanied by a statement showing
      wherein such federal determination and such notice of additional tax due
      are erroneous.
        (2)  Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for
      the purposes  of  this  section,  subdivision  (f)  of  section  11-1787
      (limiting  credits  or refunds after petition to the tax commission), or
      subdivision (b) of section 11-1789 (authorizing the filing of a petition
      with the tax commission based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall such
      assessment or the collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions  of
      subdivision (c) of this section.
        (3)  If  a  husband  and  wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice of
      additional tax due may be a single joint notice, except that if the  tax
      commission  has  been notified by either spouse that separate residences
      have been established, then, in lieu of the joint  notice,  a  duplicate
      original  of  the  joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse at his or
      her last known address in or out of  this  state.  If  the  taxpayer  is
      deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may
      be  mailed  to  his  or  her last known address in or out of this state,
      unless the tax commission has received notice  of  the  existence  of  a
      fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.
        (f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or
      not  a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive the
      restrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or  any  part  of
      the  deficiency  by  a  signed  notice  in  writing  filed  with the tax
      commission.
        (g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of  this  chapter,  a  deficiency
      means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (i) the amount
      shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made
      or the tax computed by such taxpayer or by the tax commission), and less
      (ii)  the  amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment)
      as a deficiency and plus (iii)  the  amount  of  any  rebates.  For  the
      purpose  of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax
      shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to  payments
      on  account  of  estimated  tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a
      rebate means so much of an abatement, credit, refund or other  repayment
      (whether  or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering
      into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance  in  favor  of  the
      taxpayer.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1782
---------------

Section 11-1782 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1782  Assessment. (a) Assessment date. The amount of tax which a
      return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return  would  have
      shown  to  be  due  but  for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be
      assessed on the date of filing of  the  return  (including  any  amended
      return  showing  an  increase  of tax). In the case of a return properly
      filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by the tax commission
      shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment is due. If a
      notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall
      be deemed to be assessed on the date specified  in  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-1781  if no petition to the tax commission is filed, or if a
      petition is filed, then upon  the  date  when  a  decision  of  the  tax
      commission  establishing  the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If
      an amended return or report filed pursuant to section  11-1759  concedes
      the  accuracy  of  a federal change or correction, any deficiency in tax
      under this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on
      the date of filing such report or amended return,  and  such  assessment
      shall  be  timely  notwithstanding  section  11-1783.  If  a  notice  of
      additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of section 11-1781,
      has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency  shall  be  deemed  to  be
      assessed  on the date specified in such subdivision unless within thirty
      days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal change  or
      correction  or  an  amended  return,  where  such return was required by
      section 11-1759, is filed accompanied by  a  statement  showing  wherein
      such  federal  determination  and  such notice of additional tax due are
      erroneous. Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax,  other  than
      amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be
      deemed   to   be   assessed   upon  the  date  of  receipt  of  payment,
      notwithstanding any other provisions.
        (b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of
      any tax under this chapter (including interest,  additions  to  tax  and
      assessable  penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the tax commission
      may establish the same by regulations.
        (c) Estimated income tax. No unpaid amount of estimated tax  shall  be
      assessed.
        (d)  Supplemental  assessment.  The  tax  commission  may, at any time
      within  the  period  prescribed  for  assessment,  make  a  supplemental
      assessment,   subject   to  the  provisions  of  section  11-1781  where
      applicable, whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is  imperfect
      or incomplete in any material respect.
        (e)  Cross  reference. For assessment in case of jeopardy, see section
      11-1794.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1783
---------------

Section 11-1783 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1783 Limitations on assessment. (a) General. Except as otherwise
      provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall  be  assessed
      within  three  years  after  the  return  was filed (whether or not such
      return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
        (b) Time return deemed filed.
        (1) Early return. For purposes of this section a return of income tax,
      except withholding tax, filed before the last day prescribed by  law  or
      by regulations promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof, shall
      be deemed to be filed on such last day.
        (2)  Return  of  withholding  tax.  For purposes of this section, if a
      return of withholding tax  for  any  period  ending  with  or  within  a
      calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar
      year, such return shall be deemed to be filed on April fifteenth of such
      succeeding calendar year.
        (c) Exceptions.
        (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if:
        (A) no return is filed,
        (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or
        (C) the taxpayer or employer fails to comply with section 11-1759.
        (2)  Extension  by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time
      prescribed in this section for the  assessment  of  tax,  both  the  tax
      commission  and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment
      after such time, the tax may be  assessed  at  any  time  prior  to  the
      expiration  of  the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be
      extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the  expiration
      of the period previously agreed upon.
        (3)  Report  of  federal changes, corrections or disallowances. If the
      taxpayer or employer complies with section 11-1759, the  assessment  (if
      not  deemed  to  have been made upon the filing of the report or amended
      return) may be made at any time within two years after  such  report  or
      amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not
      exceed  the  amount  of  the  increase  in city tax attributable to such
      federal change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
      affect the time within which or the amount for which an  assessment  may
      otherwise be made.
        (4)  Deficiency  attributable  to  net  operating loss carryback. If a
      deficiency is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of  a  net
      operating  loss  carryback,  it  may  be  assessed  at  any  time that a
      deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.
        (5) Recovery  of  erroneous  refund.  An  erroneous  refund  shall  be
      considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of
      a  deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time
      within two years  from  the  making  of  the  refund,  except  that  the
      assessment  may  be made within five years from the making of the refund
      if it appears that any part of  the  refund  was  induced  by  fraud  or
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
        (6)  Request  for  prompt  assessment.  If  a return is required for a
      decedent or for a decedent's estate during the period of administration,
      the tax shall be assessed within eighteen months after  written  request
      therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator
      or  other  person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more
      than three years  after  the  return  was  filed,  except  as  otherwise
      provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section.
        (7)  Report  on  use  of  certain  property.  Under  the circumstances
      described in paragraph two of subdivision (g) of  section  11-1712,  the
      tax  may  be  assessed  within  three years after the filing of a return
      reporting that property has been used for purposes other  than  research
      and development to a greater extent than originally reported.
    
        (8)  Report concerning waste treatment facility, air pollution control
      facility  or  eligible  business  facility.  Under   the   circumstances
      described in paragraph three of subdivision (h) of section 11-1712 or in
      paragraph five of subsection (c) of section seven hundred one of the tax
      law,  the  tax  may  be  assessed within three years after filing of the
      return containing the information required by such paragraph, or,  if  a
      certificate  of  compliance  in  respect  to  an  air  pollution control
      facility shall be revoked, within three years after the  tax  commission
      shall receive notice of such revocation from the taxpayer or as required
      by  section  19-0309  of  the  environmental conservation law, whichever
      notice is received earlier.
        (d) Omission of income, item of tax preference, total  taxable  amount
      or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution on return. The tax
      may  be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed
      if:
        (1) an individual omits from his city adjusted gross income,  the  sum
      of  his items of tax preference, or the total taxable amount or ordinary
      income portion of a lump sum distribution an amount properly  includible
      therein  which is in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount of city
      adjusted gross income, the sum of the items of  tax  preference  or  the
      total   taxable  amount  or  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum
      distribution stated in the return, or
        (2) an estate or trust omits from its city adjusted gross income,  the
      sum  of  its  items  of  tax  preference, or the total taxable amount or
      ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution  an  amount  properly
      includible  therein  which  is  in  excess of twenty-five percent of the
      amount stated in the return of city adjusted gross income, or the sum of
      the items of tax preference, or the total  taxable  amount  or  ordinary
      income portion of a lump sum distribution, respectively. For purposes of
      this paragraph, city adjusted gross income means New York adjusted gross
      income  as  determined under paragraph four of subsection (e) of section
      six hundred one of the tax law.
        For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account
      any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in
      the return, or in a statement  attached  to  the  return,  in  a  manner
      adequate  to  apprise  the  commissioner of the nature and amount of the
      item of income, tax preference, the total  taxable  amount  or  ordinary
      income portion of a lump sum distribution.
        (e)  Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the
      period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount
      (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of
      deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the tax  commission
      is  prohibited  under subdivision (c) of section 11-1781 from making the
      assessment or from collecting by levy.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1784
---------------

Section 11-1784 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1784  Interest  on  underpayment.  (a) General. If any amount of
      income tax is not paid on or before the last  date  prescribed  in  this
      chapter  for  payment,  interest on such amount at the underpayment rate
      set by the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  pursuant  to  section
      11-1797  of  this subchapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of seven
      and one-half percent per annum shall be paid for the  period  from  such
      last  date  to  the  date paid, whether or not any extension of time for
      payment was granted. Interest under this subdivision shall not  be  paid
      if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. If the time for filing of
      a  return of tax withheld by an employer is extended, the employer shall
      pay interest for the period for which the extension is granted  and  may
      not charge such interest to the employee.
        (b) Exception as to estimated tax. This section shall not apply to any
      failure to pay estimated tax.
        (c)  Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on
      any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer
      files a return within the time prescribed in this chapter (including any
      extension of time) and pays the  amount  of  underpayment  within  three
      months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended.
        (d)   Suspension   of   interest  on  deficiencies.  If  a  waiver  of
      restrictions on assessment  of  a  deficiency  has  been  filed  by  the
      taxpayer,  and if notice and demand by the tax commission for payment of
      such deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of  such
      waiver,  interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period
      beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the  date
      of notice and demand.
        (e)  Tax  reduced  by  carryback. If the amount of tax for any taxable
      year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating  loss,  such
      reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this
      section  for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year
      in which the net operating  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date  shall  be
      determined without regard to extensions of time to file.
        (f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid
      upon  notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the
      same manner as income tax. Any reference in  this  chapter  to  the  tax
      imposed  by  this  chapter  shall  be  deemed  also to refer to interest
      imposed by this section on such tax.
        (g) Interest on penalties or  additions  to  tax.  Interest  shall  be
      imposed  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  in  respect  of any
      assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or
      addition to tax is not paid within twenty-one  calendar  days  from  the
      date  of the notice and demand therefor under subdivision (b) of section
      11-1792 of this title (ten business days if the amount  for  which  such
      notice  and  demand  is  made  equals  or  exceeds  one hundred thousand
      dollars), and in such case interest shall be imposed only for the period
      from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.
        (h) Payment within specified period after notice and demand. If notice
      and demand is made for payment of any amount under  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-1792  of  this  title,  and  if  such  amount is paid within
      twenty-one calendar days (ten business days if the amount for which such
      notice and demand  is  made  equals  or  exceeds  one  hundred  thousand
      dollars)  after  the date of such notice and demand, interest under this
      section on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period  after
      the date of such notice and demand.
        (i) Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under
      this  section  may  be  assessed  and  collected, at any time during the
      period within which the tax or  other  amount  to  which  such  interest
      relates may be assessed and collected, respectively.
    
        (j)  Interest  on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount
      which has been erroneously refunded, and which  is  recoverable  by  the
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance,  shall  bear  interest  at the
      underpayment rate set by such commissioner pursuant to  section  11-1797
      of  this  subchapter,  or  if  no  rate is set, at the rate of seven and
      one-half percent per annum from the date of the payment of  the  refund,
      but  only if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud
      or a misrepresentation of a material fact.
        (k) Satisfaction by credits. If any portion of a tax is  satisfied  by
      credit  of  an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this
      section on the portion of the tax so satisfied  for  any  period  during
      which,  if  the  credit  had  not  been  made,  interest would have been
      allowable with respect to such overpayment.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1785
---------------

Section 11-1785 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1785  Additions  to  tax and civil penalties. (a) (1) Failure to
      file tax return. (A) In case of failure to file a tax return under  this
      chapter  on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any
      extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such  failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount required to be shown as  tax  on  such  return  five
      percent  of  the  amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than
      one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to any extension of time for filing),  unless  it  is  shown  that  such
      failure  is  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the
      addition to tax hereunder shall not be  less  than  the  lesser  of  one
      hundred  dollars  or  one  hundred  percent of the amount required to be
      shown as tax on such return.
        (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required  to  be
      shown  on  the  return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the
      tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for  payment  of  the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        (2)  Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the
      amounts shown as tax on any return  required  to  be  filed  under  this
      chapter  on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any
      extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one  percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with  an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or
      fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
      twenty-five  percent  in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
      addition for any month, the amount of tax shown on the return  shall  be
      reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
      the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
      tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
      to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
      return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
      amount.
        (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.  In  case  of
      failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
      a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not  so  shown
      (including  an  assessment  made  pursuant to subdivision (a) of section
      11-1782 of this title) within twenty-one calendar days of the date of  a
      notice  and  demand  therefor (ten business days if the amount for which
      such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds  one  hundred  thousand
      dollars),  unless  it  is  shown  that such failure is due to reasonable
      cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount
      of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of  such
      tax  if  the  failure is not for more than one month, with an additional
      one-half of one percent for each additional month  or  fraction  thereof
      during  which  such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent
      in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the  addition  for  any
      month,  the  amount  of  tax  stated  in  the notice and demand shall be
      reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is  paid  before  the
      beginning of such month.
        (4)  Limitations  on  additions.  (A)  With respect to any return, the
      amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall  be
    
      reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  addition  under paragraph two of this
      subdivision for any month  to  which  an  addition  applies  under  both
      paragraphs  one  and  two  of this subdivision. In any case described in
      subparagraph  (B)  of such paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount
      of the addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below  the
      amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B)  With  respect  to  any return, the maximum amount of the addition
      permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced  by
      the  amount  of  the  addition  under  paragraph one of this subdivision
      (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph)  which
      is  attributable  to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and
      which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        (b) Deficiency due to negligence. (1) If any part of a  deficiency  is
      due  to  negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or rules or
      regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud),  there  shall  be
      added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.
        (2)  There  shall  be  added  to  the  tax  (in addition to the amount
      determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount  equal  to
      fifty percent of the interest payable under section 11-1784 with respect
      to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which
      is  attributable  to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to
      in such paragraph, for the period beginning on the last date  prescribed
      by  law  for  payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to
      any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax  (or,
      if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).
        (3)  If  any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect
      to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection  (a)  of
      section  six  thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand
      forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine  of  the
      internal  revenue code, respectively, and the payee fails to include any
      portion of such payment in city adjusted gross income, any portion of an
      underpayment attributable to such failure shall be treated, for purposes
      of this subdivision, as due to negligence in the absence  of  clear  and
      convincing  evidence  to  the  contrary. If any penalty is imposed under
      this subdivision by reason of the preceding sentence, the amount of  the
      penalty  imposed  by  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision shall be five
      percent of the portion of the underpayment which is attributable to  the
      failure described in the preceding sentence.
        (c) Failure by individual to pay estimated income tax. (1) Addition to
      the   tax.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  subdivision  and
      subdivision (d) of this section, in the  case  of  any  underpayment  of
      estimated  tax  by  an individual, there shall be added to the tax under
      this chapter for the taxable year an amount determined by  applying  the
      underpayment  rate established under section 11-1797 of this subchapter,
      or if no rate is set, at the rate of  seven  and  one-half  percent  per
      annum,  to  the  amount  of  the  underpayment  for  the  period  of the
      underpayment. Such period shall run from the due date for  the  required
      installment  to  the  earlier  of  the fifteenth day of the fourth month
      following the close of the taxable year or, with respect to any  portion
      of  the  underpayment,  the  date  on  which  such  portion is paid. For
      purposes of determining such date, a payment of estimated tax  shall  be
      credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which such
      installments  are  required  to  be  paid.  There shall be four required
      installments for  each  taxable  year,  due  on  April  fifteenth,  June
      fifteenth  and  September  fifteenth of such taxable year and on January
      fifteenth of the following taxable year.
        (2) Amount of underpayment. For purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision,  the  amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of the
    
      required installment over the amount, if any, of the installment paid on
      or before the due date for the installment.
        (3)  Required installment. (A) Except as provided in paragraph four of
      this subdivision, the  amount  of  any  required  installment  shall  be
      twenty-five percent of the required annual payment.
        (B) The required annual payment is the lesser of
        (i) ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year
      (or, if no return is filed, ninety percent of the tax for such year), or
        (ii)  one  hundred  percent  of  the  tax  shown  on the return of the
      individual for the preceding taxable year. Provided, however,  that  the
      tax  shown  on  such  return for taxable years beginning in two thousand
      eight shall be calculated as if paragraph three of  subdivision  (f)  of
      section  11-1715  of  this  chapter  was  in  effect  for  taxable years
      beginning in two thousand eight. Provided, however, that the  tax  shown
      on such return for taxable years beginning in two thousand nine shall be
      calculated  as if paragraph two of subdivision (g) of section 11-1715 of
      this chapter was in effect for taxable years beginning in  two  thousand
      nine.
        Clause  (ii)  of  this  subparagraph  shall not apply if the preceding
      taxable year was  not  a  taxable  year  of  twelve  months  or  if  the
      individual did not file a return for such preceding taxable year.
        (C) Limitation on use of preceding year's tax.
        (i)  General. If the city adjusted gross income shown on the return of
      the individual for the preceding taxable year exceeds one hundred  fifty
      thousand  dollars,  clause  (ii)  of  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph
      shall be applied by substituting "one  hundred  ten  percent"  for  "one
      hundred percent".
        (ii)  Separate  returns.  In  the  case of a husband and wife who file
      separate returns pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 11-1751 for  the
      taxable   year  for  which  the  amount  of  the  installment  is  being
      determined,  clause  (i)  of  this  subparagraph  shall  be  applied  by
      substituting  "seventy-five  thousand  dollars"  for  "one hundred fifty
      thousand dollars".
        (4) Annualized income installment. (A) In general. In the case of  any
      required  installment, if the individual establishes that the annualized
      income installment determined under subparagraph (B) of  this  paragraph
      is  less  than  the  amount  determined  under  paragraph  three of this
      subdivision, the annualized income installment  shall  be  the  required
      installment.  Any reduction in a required installment resulting from the
      application of this subparagraph shall be recaptured by  increasing  the
      amount of the next required installment determined under paragraph three
      of  this  subdivision by the amount of such reduction, and by increasing
      successive required installments as necessary to effect full recapture.
        (B) Determination of annualized income installment. In the case of any
      required installment, the annualized income installment is  the  excess,
      if  any,  of an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the tax for
      the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the  taxable
      income  and minimum taxable income for months in the taxable year ending
      before the due date for the installment, over the  aggregate  amount  of
      any  prior  required  installments  for the taxable year. The applicable
      percentage of the tax shall be twenty-two and one-half  percent  in  the
      case  of  the  first  installment, forty-five percent in the case of the
      second installment, sixty-seven and one-half percent in the case of  the
      third  installment  and  ninety  percent  in  the  case  of  the  fourth
      installment, and shall be computed without regard to any increase in the
      rates applicable to the taxable year unless such increase was enacted at
      least thirty days prior to the due date of the installment.
    
        (5) Definitions and special rules. (A) Definition of the term tax  and
      application of credits against tax. For purposes of this subdivision and
      subdivision  (d)  of  this section, the term "tax" means the tax imposed
      under this chapter minus the credits  against  tax  allowed  under  this
      chapter,  other  than  the credit under section 11-1773, relating to tax
      withheld on wages. The credit allowed  under  section  11-1773  for  the
      taxable  year  shall  be deemed a payment of estimated tax, and an equal
      part of such amount shall be deemed paid on each  installment  due  date
      for  such  taxable  year,  unless  the taxpayer establishes the dates on
      which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the  amounts  so
      withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which
      such amounts were actually withheld.
        (B) Special rule where return filed on or before January thirty-first.
      If, on or before January thirty-first of the following taxable year, the
      taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount
      computed  on  the  return  as  payable, then no addition to tax shall be
      imposed under pargraph one of  this  subdivision  with  respect  to  any
      underpayment of the fourth required installment for the taxable year.
        (C)  Special  rules  for  farmers  and fishermen. For purposes of this
      subdivision, if an individual is a farmer or fisherman for  any  taxable
      year  there shall be only one required installment for the taxable year,
      due on January fifteenth of the following  taxable  year  in  an  amount
      equal to the required annual payment determined under paragraph three of
      this  subdivision  by  substituting sixty-six and two-thirds percent for
      ninety percent and without regard to subparagraph (C) of paragraph three
      of this subdivision. Subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be applied
      by substituting March first for January thirty-first and by treating the
      required installment under this  subparagraph  as  the  fourth  required
      installment. An individual is a farmer or fisherman for any taxable year
      if  the  individual's  federal  gross  income  from  farming  or fishing
      (including oyster farming) for the taxable year is at  least  two-thirds
      of  the total federal gross income from all sources for the taxable year
      or if such individual's federal gross income  from  farming  or  fishing
      (including oyster farming) shown on the return of the individual for the
      preceding taxable year is at least two-thirds of the total federal gross
      income from all sources shown on such return.
        (D)  Fiscal  years.  In  applying  this  subdivision to a taxable year
      beginning  on  any  date  other  than  January  first,  there  shall  be
      substituted,  for  the  months specified in this subdivision, the months
      which correspond thereto.
        (E) Short taxable year. This subdivision shall be applied  to  taxable
      years  of  less  than  twelve  months  in  accordance  with  regulations
      prescribed by the tax commission.
        (F) Joint estimated tax of husband and wife. A husband  and  wife  may
      make  the  required  annual  payment determined under paragraph three of
      this subdivision as if  they  were  one  taxpayer,  in  which  case  the
      liability  under  paragraph  one of this subdivision with respect to the
      estimated tax shall be joint and several. No such joint payment  may  be
      made  if  husband  and  wife  are separated under a decree of divorce or
      separate maintenance, or if they have  different  taxable  years.  If  a
      joint  payment  is made but husband and wife determine their taxes under
      this chapter separately, the estimated tax for such year may be  treated
      as  the  estimated  tax  of  either  husband  or wife, or may be divided
      between them, as they may elect.
        (6) Trusts and certain estates. (A) General.  This  subdivision  shall
      apply to any trust or estate except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and
      (C) of this paragraph.
    
        (B)  Exception  for estates and certain trusts. This subdivision shall
      not apply with respect to any taxable year ending before  the  date  two
      years  after  the date of the decedent's death to (i) the estate of such
      decedent or (ii) any trust all of which was treated (under subpart E  of
      part  I  of subchapter J of chapter one of the internal revenue code) as
      owned by the decedent and to which the residue of the decedent's  estate
      will  pass  under his will (or, if no will is admitted to probate, which
      is the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes and  expenses
      of administration).
        (C)  Special  rule  for  annualizations.  In the case of any estate or
      trust, subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of this subdivision  shall  be
      applied by substituting "ending before the date one month before the due
      date  for  the  installment"  for  "ending  before  the due date for the
      installment".
        (D) In the case of a trust, the trustee may elect to treat any portion
      of a payment of estimated tax made by such trust for any taxable year of
      the trust as a payment made by a beneficiary of such trust.  Any  amount
      so  treated  shall  be treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on
      the last day of such taxable year, and for purposes of this subdivision,
      the amount so treated shall not be treated as a payment of estimated tax
      made by the trust, but shall be treated as a payment  of  estimated  tax
      made  by  such beneficiary on the January fifteenth following the end of
      the trust's taxable year.
        (E) An election under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall be made
      on or before the sixty-fifth day after the close of the taxable year and
      in  such  manner  as  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  may
      prescribe.
        (F)  Extension  to last year of estate.--In the case of a taxable year
      reasonably expected to be the  last  taxable  year  of  an  estate,  any
      reference  in  subparagraph  (D)  of  this paragraph to a trust shall be
      treated as including a reference to an estate, and the fiduciary of  the
      estate shall be treated as the trustee.
        (d)  Exceptions to addition to tax for failure to pay estimated income
      tax.
        (1) Where tax is small amount. No addition to  tax  shall  be  imposed
      under  subdivision  (c)  of this section for any taxable year if the tax
      shown on the return for such taxable year (or, if no  return  is  filed,
      the tax), reduced by the credit allowable under section 11-1773, is less
      than three hundred dollars.
        (2)  Where no tax liability for preceding taxable year. No addition to
      tax shall be imposed under subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  for  any
      taxable  year if the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve
      months, the individual did not have any liability  for  tax  under  this
      chapter  for  the  preceding  taxable  year and throughout the preceding
      taxable year the individual was a resident of this city or a nonresident
      who had city adjusted gross income.
        (3) Installment due on or after individual's death. No addition to tax
      shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section with  respect  to
      any installment due on or after the individual's death.
        (4)  Waiver in certain cases. (A) In general. No addition to tax shall
      be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section  with  respect  to  any
      underpayment  to the extent the tax commission determines that by reason
      of casualty, disaster or other unusual circumstances the  imposition  of
      such addition to tax would be against equity and good conscience.
        (B) Newly retired or disabled individuals. No addition to tax shall be
      imposed  under  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  with respect to any
      underpayment if the tax commission determines that in the  taxable  year
      for  which estimated payments were required to be made or in the taxable
    
      year preceding such taxable  year  the  taxpayer  retired  after  having
      attained  age  sixty-two  or became disabled, and that such underpayment
      was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
        (e) Deficiency due to fraud. (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to
      fraud,  there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty percent
      of the deficiency.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable under section 11-1784 with respect
      to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which
      is attributable to fraud, for the  period  beginning  on  the  last  day
      prescribed  by  law for payment of such underpayment (determined without
      regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the
      tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).
        (3) The addition to tax under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any
      other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b) of this section.
        (4) In the  case  of  a  joint  return  under  section  11-1751,  this
      subdivision  shall  not apply with respect to the tax of a spouse unless
      some part of the underpayment is due to the fraud of such spouse.
        (f) Non-willful failure to  pay  withholding  tax.  If  any  employer,
      without intent to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the
      payment  thereof,  shall fail to make a return and pay a tax withheld by
      him or her at the time required by or under the  provisions  of  section
      11-1774,  such  employer  shall be liable for such tax and shall pay the
      same together with interest thereon and the addition to tax provided  in
      subdivision  (a)  of this section, and such interest and addition to tax
      shall not be charged to or collected from the employee by the  employer.
      The  tax  commission  shall  have  the  same  rights  and powers for the
      collection of such tax,  interest  and  addition  to  tax  against  such
      employer as are now prescribed by this chapter for the collection of tax
      against an individual taxpayer.
        (g)  Willful  failure to collect and pay over tax. Any person required
      to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax imposed by this
      chapter who willfully fails to collect such tax  or  truthfully  account
      for  and  pay over such tax or willfully attempts in any manner to evade
      or defeat the tax or the payment thereof, shall, in  addition  to  other
      penalties  provided  by  law,  be liable to a penalty equal to the total
      amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or  not  accounted  for  and
      paid  over.  No  addition  to  tax  under subdivision (b) or (e) of this
      section shall be imposed  for  any  offense  to  which  this  subsection
      applies.  The tax commission shall have the power, in its discretion, to
      waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.
        (h) Failure  to  file  certain  information  returns.  (1)  Except  as
      otherwise  provided in this paragraph, in case of each failure to file a
      statement of a payment to another person, required  under  authority  of
      subdivision  (d)  of section 11-1758 (relating to information at source,
      including the duplicate statement of tax withheld on wages) on the  date
      prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for
      filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause
      and  not  to willful neglect, there shall, upon notice and demand by the
      tax commission and in the same manner as tax, be paid by the  person  so
      failing  to  file  the  statement,  a  penalty of fifty dollars for each
      statement not so filed, but the total amount imposed on  the  delinquent
      person  for  all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed
      ten thousand dollars.
        (2) If any partnership or S corporation required to file a  return  or
      report under subdivision (c) of section 11-1758 or under section 11-1759
      for  any  taxable  year  fails to file such return or report at the time
    
      prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for
      filing), or files a return or report which fails to show the information
      required under such subdivision (c) or section  11-1759,  unless  it  is
      shown  that  such  failure  is  due  to  reasonable cause and not due to
      willful neglect, there shall, upon notice and demand by the commissioner
      and in the same  manner  as  tax,  be  paid  by  the  partnership  or  S
      corporation  a penalty for each month (or fraction thereof) during which
      such failure continues (but not to exceed five months).  The  amount  of
      such  penalty  for any month is the product of fifty dollars, multiplied
      by the number of partners in the partnership or shareholders  in  the  S
      corporation  during any part of the taxable year who were subject to tax
      under this chapter during any part of such taxable year.
        (i) Additional penalty. Any person who with  fraudulent  intent  shall
      fail  to  pay,  or  to  deduct or withhold and pay, any tax, or to make,
      render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information  within
      the  time  required by or under this chapter, shall be liable to penalty
      of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other  amounts
      required  under  this  chapter, to be imposed, assessed and collected by
      the tax commission. The tax commission shall  have  the  power,  in  its
      discretion,  to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any  penalty under this
      subdivision.
        (j) Fraudulent statement or failure to furnish statement to  employee.
      In  addition  to  any  criminal  penalties  provided  by law, any person
      required under the provisions of section 11-1772 to furnish a  statement
      to an employee, who willfully furnishes a false or fraudulent statement,
      or  who  willfully  fails  to  furnish a statement in the manner, at the
      time, and showing the information required  under  section  11-1772,  or
      regulations  prescribed  thereunder,  shall  for  each  such  failure be
      subject to a penalty under this chapter of fifty dollars.
        (k) Failure to supply  identifying  numbers.  If  any  person  who  is
      required  by  regulations  prescribed  under  subdivision (b) of section
      11-1758:
        (1) to include his or her identifying number in any return, statement,
      or other document;
        (2) to furnish his or her identifying number to another person; or
        (3) to include in any return, statement or other  document  made  with
      respect  to  another person the identifying number of such other person,
      fails to comply with such requirement at the  time  prescribed  by  such
      regulations,  such person shall, unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a penalty of
      five dollars for each such failure described in paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision  and  fifty  dollars  for  each  such  failure  described in
      paragraph two of this subdivision, and this paragraph, except  that  the
      total  amount  imposed  on  such person for all such failures during any
      calendar year shall not exceed ten thousand  dollars;  except  that  for
      failure  to  include his or her own identification number in any return,
      statement or other document, such penalty shall not  be  imposed  unless
      such person shall have failed to supply his or her identification number
      to the tax commission within thirty days after demand therefor.
        (l)  Additions  treated  as  tax.  The  additions to tax and penalties
      provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and  shall
      be  assessed,  collected  and  paid in the same manner as taxes, and any
      reference in this chapter to income tax or tax imposed by this  chapter,
      shall  be  deemed  also  to  refer to the additions to tax and penalties
      provided  by  this  section.  For  purposes  of  section  11-1781,  this
      subdivision shall not apply to:
        (1)  any  addition  to  tax  under  subdivision  (a) except as to that
      portion attributable to a deficiency;
    
        (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c);
        (3) any penalty under subdivision (h) and any additional penalty under
      subdivision (i); and
        (4) any penalties under subdivisions (j), (k), (q), (r), (s) and (t).
        (m)  Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b) and
      (e) of this section, the amount shown as the tax by  the  taxpayer  upon
      his  or her return shall be taken into account in determining the amount
      of the deficiency only if such return was filed on or  before  the  last
      day  prescribed for the filing of such return, determined with regard to
      any extension of time for such filing.
        (n) Person defined. For purposes of subdivisions (g),  (i),  (o),  (q)
      and  (r)  of  this  section,  the  term  person  includes an individual,
      corporation, partnership or limited liability company or an  officer  or
      employee  of  any  corporation (including a dissolved corporation), or a
      member or employee of any partnership, or a member, manager or  employee
      of  a  limited liability company, who as such officer, employee, manager
      or member is under a duty to perform the act in  respect  of  which  the
      violation occurs.
        (o)  Failure  to  make  deposits  of  taxes. In case of failure by any
      person required by this chapter, or by regulations of the tax commission
      under this chapter, to deposit  on  the  date  prescribed  therefor  any
      amount  of  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  in  a depository authorized
      pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-1792 to receive such deposits,
      unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and  not
      due  to willful neglect, there shall be imposed on such person a penalty
      of five percent of the amount of the underpayment. For purposes of  this
      subdivision  the  term  "underpayment" means the excess of the amount of
      the tax required to be so deposited over the amount,  if  any,  thereof,
      deposited on or before the date prescribed therefor.
        (p) Substantial understatement of liability. If there is a substantial
      understatement  of income tax for any taxable year, there shall be added
      to the tax an  amount  equal  to  ten  percent  of  the  amount  of  any
      underpayment  attributable  to such understatement. For purposes of this
      subdivision, there is a substantial understatement of income tax for any
      taxable year if the amount of the understatement for  the  taxable  year
      exceeds  the  greater  of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on
      the return for the taxable year, or two thousand dollars.  For  purposes
      of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of
      the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable
      year,  over  the  amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return
      reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of subdivision (g) of  section
      11-1781).  The  amount  of  such understatement shall be reduced by that
      portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment
      of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for
      such treatment, or any item with respect to  which  the  relevant  facts
      affecting  the  item's  tax  treatment  are  adequately disclosed in the
      return or in a statement attached to the return. The tax commission  may
      waive  all  or  any  part  of  the  addition  to  tax  provided  by this
      subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause
      for the understatement, or part thereof, and that the taxpayer acted  in
      good faith.
        (q) Frivolous tax returns. If any individual files what purports to be
      a  return  of any tax imposed by this chapter but which does not contain
      information on which the substantial correctness of the  self-assessment
      may  be  judged, or contains information that on its face indicates that
      the self-assessment is substantially incorrect; and such conduct is  due
      to  a  position  which  is frivolous, or an intent (which appears on the
      purported return) to delay or impede the administration of this chapter,
    
      then such individual shall pay a  penalty  not  exceeding  five  hundred
      dollars. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty provided
      by law.
        (r)  Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports,
      statements or other documents. (1) Any person who, with the intent  that
      tax  be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident
      to the performance of other services  for  which  such  person  receives
      compensation,  aid  or  assist  in,  or  procure, counsel, or advise the
      preparation or presentation under, or  in  connection  with  any  matter
      arising under this chapter of any return, report, declaration, statement
      or  other  document  which  is  fraudulent  or  false as to any material
      matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information,  whether  or  not
      such  falsity  or  fraud  is with the knowledge or consent of the person
      authorized or required to  present  such  return,  report,  declaration,
      statement  or  other  document  shall  pay  a  penalty not exceeding one
      thousand dollars.
        (2) For purposes of  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision,  the  term
      "procures"  includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to do
      an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation  by
      a  subordinate  in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person
      (whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the  taxpayer
      involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision or
      control.
        (3)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this subdivision, a person
      furnishing typing, reproducing,  or  other  mechanical  assistance  with
      respect  to  a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted
      in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.
        (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be  in  addition  to
      any other penalty provided by law.
        (s)  False information with respect to withholding. In addition to any
      criminal penalty provided by law, if any individual  makes  a  statement
      under  section  11-1771  which  results  in  a  decrease  in the amounts
      deducted and withheld under this  chapter,  and  as  of  the  time  such
      statement  was  made,  there was no reasonable basis for such statement,
      such individual shall pay a penalty of five  hundred  dollars  for  such
      statement. The tax commission shall waive the penalty imposed under this
      subdivision  if  the  taxes imposed with respect to the individual under
      this chapter for the taxable year are equal to or less than the  sum  of
      the credits against such taxes allowed by this chapter, and the payments
      of estimated tax which are considered payments on account of such taxes.
        (t)   Failure   of   tax   return   preparer  to  conform  to  certain
      requirements.--(1) Failure to sign  return  or  claim  for  refund.  Any
      individual  who  is  a tax return preparer with respect to any return or
      claim  for  refund,  who  is  required  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision  (g)  of  section  11-1758  to sign such return or claim for
      refund, and who fails to comply with such requirement  with  respect  to
      such  return or claim for refund, shall be subject to a penalty of fifty
      dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that such  failure  is
      due  to  reasonable  cause  and  not due to willful neglect. The maximum
      penalty imposed under this paragraph  on  any  person  with  respect  to
      returns  or  claims  for refund filed during any calendar year shall not
      exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.
        (2) Failure to furnish identifying number. If any  identifying  number
      required  to  be  included on any return or claim for refund pursuant to
      paragraph two of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 is not so  included,
      the person who is the tax return preparer with respect to such return or
      claim  for  refund  shall  be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars with
      respect to such return or claim for refund unless it is shown that  such
    
      failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. For purposes
      of  this  paragraph, where an employer and one or more employees of such
      employer are tax return preparers with respect to  the  same  return  or
      claim for refund or where a partnership and one or more partners in such
      partnership  are tax return preparers with respect to the same return or
      claim for refund, such employer or such partnership shall be  deemed  to
      be the sole tax return preparer with respect to such return or claim for
      refund.  The  maximum penalty imposed under this paragraph on any person
      with respect to returns or claims for refund filed during  any  calendar
      year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.
        (3)  Failure  to  furnish  copy  to  taxpayer. Any person who is a tax
      return preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund,  who  is
      required  under paragraph three of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 to
      furnish a copy of such return or claim for refund to the  taxpayer,  and
      who  fails  to comply with such provision with respect to such return or
      claim for refund shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each
      such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is due to  reasonable
      cause  and not due to willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under
      this paragraph on any person with  respect  to  returns  or  claims  for
      refund  filed  during  any  calendar  year  shall not exceed twenty-five
      thousand dollars.
        (4) Failure to retain copy or list. Any person who  is  a  tax  return
      preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund, who is required
      under  paragraph  four  of  subdivision  (g)  of section 11-1758 to: (i)
      retain a copy of such return or claim for refund or retain on a list the
      name and taxpayer identifying number  of  the  taxpayer  for  whom  such
      return  or claim for refund was prepared and (ii) make such copy or list
      available for inspection upon request by the  commissioner  of  taxation
      and  finance,  and who fails to comply with the retention requirement or
      who complies with the retention requirement but  fails  to  comply  with
      such request by the commissioner, shall be subject to a penalty of fifty
      dollars  for  each such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due  to  willful  neglect.  The  maximum
      penalty  imposed  under this paragraph on any person with respect to any
      calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.
        * (5) Failure to electronically file. If  a  tax  return  preparer  is
      required  to  file  returns  electronically pursuant to paragraph ten of
      subdivision (g) of section 11-1758, and such preparer fails to file  one
      or  more  of  such  returns  electronically, then such preparer shall be
      subject to  a  penalty  of  fifty  dollars  for  each  such  failure  to
      electronically  file  a  return, unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

Section 11-1786
---------------

Section 11-1786 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1786 Overpayment. (a) General. The state commissioner of taxation
      and  finance, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit an
      overpayment of income tax and interest on such overpayment  against  any
      liability  in  respect  of any tax imposed by this chapter or by chapter
      nineteen of this title on the person who made  the  overpayment  or  any
      other  tax  imposed  on such person pursuant to the authority of the tax
      law or  any  other  law  if  such  tax  is  administered  by  the  state
      commissioner  of  taxation and finance, against any liability in respect
      of any tax imposed on such person by the tax law  and,  as  provided  in
      sections  one  hundred  seventy-one-c,  one  hundred  seventy-one-d, one
      hundred  seventy-one-e,  one  hundred  seventy-one-f  and  one   hundred
      seventy-one-1  of  the  tax  law,  against  past-due  support, against a
      past-due legally enforceable debt,  against  a  city  of  New  York  tax
      warrant  judgment  debt and against the amount of a default in repayment
      of a guaranteed student, state university or city university  loan.  The
      balance  shall  be refunded by the state comptroller out of the proceeds
      of the tax retained by him or her for such general purpose.  Any  refund
      under  this  section  shall be made only upon the filing of a return and
      upon a certificate of the state commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
      approved by the state comptroller. The state comptroller, as a condition
      precedent  to  the  approval of such a certificate, may examine into the
      facts as disclosed by the return of the person who made the  overpayment
      and  other  information  and  data  available  in the files of the state
      commissioner of taxation and finance.
        (b) Excessive withholding. If the amount allowable as a credit for tax
      withheld from the taxpayer exceeds his or her tax to  which  the  credit
      relates, the excess shall be considered an overpayment.
        (c)  Overpayment  by employer. If there has been an overpayment of tax
      required to be deducted and withheld under section 11-1771, refund shall
      be made to the employer only to  the  extent  that  the  amount  of  the
      overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.
        (d) Overpayment by a deceased person. Notwithstanding section thirteen
      hundred ten of the surrogate's court procedure act, any overpayment by a
      decedent  not  in  excess of one thousand dollars may be refunded to the
      decedent's surviving spouse unless the return for the decedent was filed
      by his or her executor or administrator.
        (e) Credits against estimated tax. The commissioner  of  taxation  and
      finance  may  prescribe  regulations providing for the crediting against
      the estimated income tax for any taxable year of the  amount  determined
      to  be an overpayment of the income tax for a preceding taxable year. If
      any overpayment of  income  tax  is  so  claimed  as  a  credit  against
      estimated  tax  for  the  succeeding  taxable year, such amount shall be
      considered as a payment of the income tax  for  the  succeeding  taxable
      year,  and  no  claim  for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be
      allowed for the taxable year for which the  overpayment  arises,  except
      upon  request  to  the commissioner of taxation and finance on or before
      the last day prescribed for the filing of the return for the  succeeding
      taxable  year,  determined with regard to any extension of time granted.
      If good cause is shown for reversing the  credit,  the  commissioner  of
      taxation  and  finance  may,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  credit  the
      overpayment against  a  liability  or  refund  the  overpayment  without
      interest.  Provided,  the  person  who  made the overpayment will not be
      relieved  of  liability  for  any  penalty  imposed  for  a   consequent
      underpayment  of  estimated  tax  for  the  succeeding taxable year. The
      decision of the commissioner of taxation and finance to  grant  or  deny
      the  request  is  final  and  not  subject  to further administrative or
      judicial review.
    
        (f) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax  liability  for  a
      period  in respect of which an amount is paid as income tax, such amount
      shall be considered an overpayment.
        (g)  Assessment  and collection after limitation period. If any amount
      of income tax is assessed or  collected  after  the  expiration  of  the
      period  of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be
      considered an overpayment.
        (h) Cross reference. For  provision  barring  application  of  article
      fifty-two  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules to any amount to be
      refunded or credited to a taxpayer, see section seven of the tax law.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1787
---------------

Section 11-1787 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1787  Limitations  on  credit  or refund. (a) General. Claim for
      credit or refund of an overpayment of income tax shall be filed  by  the
      taxpayer  within  three  years from the time the return was filed or two
      years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods  expires
      the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the
      tax  was  paid.  If the claim is filed within the three year period, the
      amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of  the  tax
      paid  within  the  three  years  immediately preceding the filing of the
      claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If
      the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within
      the two year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed
      the portion of the tax paid during the two years  immediately  preceding
      the  filing  of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section,
      if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not  exceed
      the  amount  which  would  be allowable if a claim had been filed on the
      date the credit or refund is allowed.
        (b) Extension  of  time  by  agreement.  If  an  agreement  under  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  two  of  subdivision  (c)  of section 11-1783
      (extending the period for assessment of income tax) is made  within  the
      period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a
      claim  for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim for credit or
      refund, or for making credit or refund if no claim is filed,  shall  not
      expire  prior  to  six  months after the expiration of the period within
      which an assessment may  be  made  pursuant  to  the  agreement  or  any
      extension  thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed
      the portion of the tax paid after the execution  of  the  agreement  and
      before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as
      the  case  may  be,  plus  the portion of the tax paid within the period
      which would be applicable under subdivision (a) of  this  section  if  a
      claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed.
        (c)  Notice  of  federal  change  or correction. A claim for credit or
      refund of any overpayment of tax attributable to  a  federal  change  or
      correction  required to be reported pursuant to section 11-1759 shall be
      filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of  such
      change  or  correction  or  such amended return was required to be filed
      with the commissioner of taxation and finance. If the report or  amended
      return  required  by  section 11-1759 is not filed within the ninety day
      period therein specified, no interest shall be payable on any claim  for
      credit  or  refund of the overpayment attributable to the federal change
      or correction. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed  the
      amount  of  the  reduction  in  tax attributable to such federal change,
      correction or items amended on the taxpayer's amended federal income tax
      return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which  or  the
      amount  for  which  a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from
      this subdivision.
        (d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback. A  claim
      for  credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to
      the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback  shall
      be  filed within three years from the time the return was due (including
      extensions thereof) for the taxable year of  the  loss,  or  within  the
      period  prescribed in subdivision (b) of this section in respect of such
      taxable year, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (c) of this
      section, where applicable, in respect of the taxable year to  which  the
      net operating loss is carried back, whichever expires the latest.
        (e)  Failure  to  file  claim  within  prescribed period. No credit or
      refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in  subdivision  (f)
      of  this  section  or  subdivision  (d)  of  section  11-1790, after the
      expiration of the applicable period  of  limitation  specified  in  this
    
      chapter,  unless  a  claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer
      within such period.  Any later credit shall be void and any later refund
      erroneous. No period of limitations specified in  any  other  law  shall
      apply  to  the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect of taxes
      under this chapter.
        (f) Effect of petition to tax commission. If a  notice  of  deficiency
      for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 11-1781
      and  if  the  taxpayer  files  a timely petition with the tax commission
      under section 11-1789, it may determine that the taxpayer  has  made  an
      overpayment  for  such  year  (whether  or  not  it  also  determines  a
      deficiency for such a year). No separate claim for credit or refund  for
      such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be
      allowed or made, except:
        (1)  as to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax commission
      which has become final; and
        (2) as to any amount collected in excess  of  an  amount  computed  in
      accordance  with  the  decision  of  the tax commission which has become
      final; and
        (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the
      making of levy for collection has expired; and
        (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of  a  change  or  correction
      described in subdivision (c) of this section.
        (g)  Limit  on  amount  of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment
      determined under  subdivision  (f)  of  this  section  shall,  when  the
      decision of the tax commission has become final, be credited or refunded
      in  accordance  with  subdivision  (a)  of section 11-1786 and shall not
      exceed the amount of tax which the tax commission determines as part  of
      its decision was paid:
        (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
        (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a),
      (b)  or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice
      of deficiency a claim had been filed (whether or not filed) stating  the
      grounds   upon   which  the  tax  commission  finds  that  there  is  an
      overpayment.
        (h) Early return. For purposes  of  this  section,  any  return  filed
      before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  the  filing  thereof  shall  be
      considered as filed on such last day, determined without regard  to  any
      extension of time granted the taxpayer.
        (i)  Prepaid income tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by
      the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any  income
      tax  withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount
      paid by the taxpayer as estimated income tax for a taxable year shall be
      deemed to have been paid by him or her  on  the  fifteenth  day  of  the
      fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect
      to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment.
        (j) Return and payment of withholding tax. Notwithstanding subdivision
      (h)  of  this  section, for purposes of this section with respect to any
      withholding tax:
        (1) if a return for any period ending with or within a  calendar  year
      is  filed  before  April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such
      return shall be considered filed on April fifteenth of  such  succeeding
      calendar year; and
        (2)  if  a  tax  with  respect  to remuneration paid during any period
      ending with or within a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth  of
      the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April
      fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.
    
        (k)  Cross  reference.  For  provision  barring  refund of overpayment
      credited against tax of a succeeding year, except for good cause  shown,
      see subdivision (e) of section 11-1786.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1788
---------------

Section 11-1788 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1788  Interest  on overpayment. (a) General. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of section sixteen of the state finance law,  interest  shall
      be  allowed  and  paid  as  follows  at  the overpayment rate set by the
      commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to section 11-1797, or  if
      no  rate  is  set,  at  the  rate  of  six  percent  per  annum upon any
      overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:
        (1) from the date of the overpayment to the  due  date  of  an  amount
      against which a credit is taken;
        (2)  from  the  date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by
      the commissioner of taxation and finance) preceding the date of a refund
      check by not more than thirty days, whether or not such refund check  is
      accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The
      acceptance  of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the
      taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.
        (3) Late  and  amended  returns  and  claims  for  credit  or  refund.
      Notwithstanding paragraph one or two of this subdivision, in the case of
      an  overpayment claimed on a return of tax which is filed after the last
      date prescribed for  filing  such  return  (determined  with  regard  to
      extensions),  or  claimed  on  an  amended return of tax or claimed on a
      claim for credit or refund, no interest shall be allowed or paid for any
      day before the date on which such return or claim is filed.
        (4) Interest on  certain  refunds.  To  the  extent  provided  for  in
      regulations  promulgated by the commissioner of taxation and finance, if
      an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed  from  the
      taxable  year  or  period in which it is reported to the taxable year or
      period in which it belongs and the change results in an underpayment  in
      a  taxable  year or period and an overpayment in some other taxable year
      or period, the provisions of paragraph three of  this  subdivision  with
      respect to an overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the
      limitation  in such paragraph on the right to interest would result in a
      taxpayer not being allowed interest for a length of time with respect to
      an overpayment while being required to pay  interest  on  an  equivalent
      amount of the related underpayment. However, this paragraph shall not be
      construed  as  limiting  or  mitigating  the  effect  of  any statute of
      limitations or any other provision of law relating to the  authority  of
      such  commissioner  to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow a credit
      or refund on an overpayment.
        (5) Amounts of less than one dollar. No interest shall be  allowed  or
      paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
        (b)  Advance  payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for
      income tax withholding. The provisions of subdivisions (h)  and  (i)  of
      section 11-1787 applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for
      purposes  of  determining the period of limitations on credit or refund,
      shall be applicable in determining the date of payment for  purposes  of
      this section.
        (c) Income tax refund within forty-five days of claim for overpayment.
      If  any  overpayment  of  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter is credited or
      refunded within forty-five days  after  the  last  date  prescribed  (or
      permitted  by  extension  of  time) for filing the return of such tax on
      which such overpayment was claimed or within forty-five days after  such
      return was filed, whichever is later, or within forty-five days after an
      amended  return was filed claiming such overpayment or within forty-five
      days after a claim  for  credit  or  refund  was  filed  on  which  such
      overpayment  was  claimed,  or within six months after a demand is filed
      pursuant to paragraph six of  subsection  (b)  of  section  six  hundred
      fifty-one  of  the  tax  law,  no  interest  shall be allowed under this
      section on any such overpayment. For purposes of this  subdivision,  any
      amended  return  or claim for credit or refund filed before the last day
    
      prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for  the  filing  of  the
      return  of  tax  for such year shall be considered as filed on such last
      day.
        (d)  Refund  of  income  tax caused by carryback. For purposes of this
      section, if any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter results  from
      a  carryback  of  a net operating loss, such overpayment shall be deemed
      not to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable  year  in
      which  such  net  operating  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date  shall be
      determined without regard to extensions of time to file. For purposes of
      subdivision (c) of this section any overpayment described  herein  shall
      be  treated  as  an  overpayment  for the loss year and such subdivision
      shall be applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return
      for the loss year as not filed before  claim  for  such  overpayment  is
      filed.  The  term  "loss year" means the taxable year in which such loss
      arises.
        (e) No interest until return in processible form.
        (1) For purposes of subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section, a return
      shall not be treated as filed until it is filed in processible form.
        (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a return is  in
      a processible form if:
        (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and
        (B) such return contains:
        (i)  the  taxpayer's  name,  address,  and  identifying number and the
      required signatures, and (ii) sufficient required  information  (whether
      on  the  return  or  on required attachments) to permit the mathematical
      verification of tax liability shown on the return.
        (f) Overpayment  credited  against  past-due  support,  or  against  a
      past-due  legally  enforceable  debt,  or a city of New York tax warrant
      judgment debt, or defaulted guaranteed student, state university or city
      university loans. If interest is payable pursuant  to  this  section  on
      that  portion  of an overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter which is
      certified by the state commissioner of taxation and finance to the state
      comptroller as the amount to be credited against  past-due  support,  or
      against  a  past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax
      warrant judgment debt, or the amount of a  default  in  repayment  of  a
      guaranteed  student,  state  university  or city university loan, as the
      case  may  be,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  one  hundred
      seventy-one-c,  section  one  hundred seventy-one-d, section one hundred
      seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f or one hundred seventy-one-1 of
      the tax law, such portion of such an overpayment  shall  cease  to  bear
      interest on the date of such certification.
        (g)  Cross-reference.  For  provision  with  respect to interest after
      failure to file notice of federal  change  under  section  11-1759,  see
      subdivision (c) of section 11-1787.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1789
---------------

Section 11-1789 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1789  Petition  to  tax  commission.  (a) General. The form of a
      petition to the tax commission, and further proceedings before  the  tax
      commission  in  any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be
      governed by such  rules  as  the  tax  commission  shall  prescribe.  No
      petition  shall  be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a
      hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing shall be  conducted  by
      one  or  more  members  of  the  tax commission, or by a hearing officer
      designated by the tax commission to take evidence and report to the  tax
      commission.  The  tax  commissioners  shall,  acting  as a body, jointly
      decide the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision  shall
      be  mailed  promptly  to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail at
      his or her last known address, and such notice shall set forth  the  tax
      commission's  findings  of  fact and a brief statement of the grounds of
      decision in each case decided in whole  or  in  part  adversely  to  the
      taxpayer.
        (b)  Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety days,
      or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside
      of the United States, after the mailing  of  the  notice  of  deficiency
      authorized by section 11-1781, the taxpayer may file a petition with the
      tax  commission  for  a redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition
      may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year  or  years,
      subject to the limitations of subdivision (g) of section 11-1787.
        (c)  Petition  for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition with the tax
      commission for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:
        (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim  for  refund  with  the  tax
      commission,
        (2)  the  taxpayer  has not previously filed with the tax commission a
      timely petition under subdivision (b)  of  this  section  for  the  same
      taxable  year  unless  the  petition under this subdivision relates to a
      separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (f)
      of section 11-1787, and
        (3) either: (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed,  or
      (B)  the  tax  commission  has  mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or
      certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in  whole  or  in
      part.
        No  petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than two years
      after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless  prior  to
      the  expiration  of such two year period it has been extended by written
      agreement between the taxpayer and the tax  commission.  If  a  taxpayer
      files  a  written  waiver  of the requirement that he or she be mailed a
      notice  of  disallowance,  the  two  year  period  prescribed  by   this
      subdivision  for  filing  a  petition for refund shall begin on the date
      such waiver is filed.
        (d) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.
        (1) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If  a  taxpayer  files
      with the tax commission, a petition for redetermination of a deficiency,
      the  tax  commission  shall have power to determine a greater deficiency
      than asserted in the notice of deficiency  and  to  determine  if  there
      should  be  assessed  any addition to tax or penalty provided in section
      11-1785, if claim therefor is asserted at or before  the  hearing  under
      rules of the tax commission.
        (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with the tax commission
      a  petition  for credit or refund for a taxable year, the tax commission
      may:
        (A) determine  a  deficiency  for  such  year  as  to  any  amount  of
      deficiency  asserted  at  or  before  the hearing under rules of the tax
      commission, and within the period in which an assessment would be timely
      under section 11-1783, or
    
        (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in
      the petition, as is offset  by  other  issues  pertaining  to  the  same
      taxable  year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of
      the tax commission.
        (3)  Opportunity  to  respond.  A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable
      opportunity to respond to any matters asserted  by  the  tax  commission
      under this subdivision.
        (4)  Restriction  on  further  notices  of deficiency. If the taxpayer
      files a petition with the tax commission under this section,  no  notice
      of  deficiency under section 11-1781 may thereafter be issued by the tax
      commission for the same taxable year, except in case of  fraud  or  with
      respect  to a change or correction required to be reported under section
      11-1759.
        (e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax commission under  this
      chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the
      following  issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the tax
      commission:
        (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of  fraud  with  intent  to
      evade tax;
        (2)  whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of
      a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;
        (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a  deficiency
      where  such  increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency
      was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase
      in deficiency is the result of a change or  correction  required  to  be
      reported  under  section  11-1759, and of which change or correction the
      tax commission had no notice  at  the  time  it  mailed  the  notice  of
      deficiency; and
        (4)  whether  any person is liable for a penalty under subdivision (q)
      or (r) of section 11-1785.
        (f) Evidence of related federal determination. Evidence of  a  federal
      determination  relating  to  issues  raised  in  a  case  before the tax
      commission  under  this  section  shall  be  admissible,   under   rules
      established by the tax commission.
        (g)  Jurisdiction  over other years. The tax commission shall consider
      such facts with relation  to  the  taxes  for  other  years  as  may  be
      necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so
      doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for
      any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1790
---------------

Section 11-1790 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1790  Review of tax commission decision. (a) General. A decision
      of the tax commission  shall  be  subject  to  judicial  review  at  the
      instance  of any taxpayer effected thereby in the manner provided by law
      for the review of a final decision or action of administrative  agencies
      of  the state. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made
      within four months after notice of the decision is sent by certified  or
      registered mail to the taxpayer.
        (b)  Judicial  review  exclusive  remedy  of taxpayer. The review of a
      decision of the tax commission provided by this  section  shall  be  the
      exclusive   remedy   available   to   any   taxpayer  for  the  judicial
      determination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed  by
      this chapter.
        (c)  Assessment  pending  review;  review  bond.  Irrespective  of any
      restrictions on the assessment and collection of deficiencies,  the  tax
      commission  may  assess  a deficiency after the expiration of the period
      specified in subdivision (a) of this section,  notwithstanding  that  an
      application  for  judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been
      duly made by the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or  before  the  time
      his  or her application for review is made, has paid the deficiency, has
      deposited with the tax commission the amount of the deficiency,  or  has
      filed with the tax commission a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under
      subdivision  (h) of section 11-1794) in the amount of the portion of the
      deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in  respect  of  which
      the  application  for review is made and all costs and charges which may
      accrue against  him  or  her  in  the  prosecution  of  the  proceeding,
      including costs of all appeals, and with surety approved by a justice of
      the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned upon the payment
      of  the  deficiency  (including  interest  and other amounts) as finally
      determined and such costs and charges. If as a result of a waiver of the
      restrictions on the assessment and collection of a deficiency  any  part
      of  the amount determined by the tax commission is paid after the filing
      of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer,  be
      proportionately reduced.
        (d)  Credit,  refund  or  abatement  after  review. If the amount of a
      deficiency determined by the tax commission is disallowed in whole or in
      part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be  credited
      or  refunded  to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or,
      if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
        (e) Date of finality of tax commission decision. A decision of the tax
      commission  shall  become  final  upon  the  expiration  of  the  period
      specified  in  subdivision (a) of this section for making an application
      for review, if no such application has been duly made within such  time,
      or  if  such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time
      for all further judicial review,  or  upon  the  rendering  by  the  tax
      commission  of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on
      review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for  the  purpose  of  making  an
      application  for  review,  the  decision  of the tax commission shall be
      deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified  or
      registered mail to the taxpayer.

Section 11-1791 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1791 Mailing rules; holidays; miscellaneous. (a) Timely mailing.
      (1) If any return, claim, statement, notice, petition, or other document
      required to be filed, or any payment  required  to  be  made,  within  a
      prescribed  period  or on or before a prescribed date under authority of
      any provision of this chapter  is,  after  such  period  or  such  date,
      delivered  by  United States mail to the tax commission, bureau, office,
      officer or person with which or with whom such document is  required  to
      be  filed,  or  to which or to whom such payment is required to be made,
      the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall  be
      deemed  to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if
      the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the
      prescribed date for the filing of  such  document,  or  for  making  the
      payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and
      only  if  such  document  or  payment was deposited in the mail, postage
      prepaid, properly addressed  to  the  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,
      officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be
      filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any
      document  or  payment  is  sent  by  United States registered mail, such
      registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document or payment
      was delivered to the tax commission, bureau, office, officer  or  person
      to  which  or  to  whom addressed. To the extent that the tax commission
      shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be  used  in  lieu  of
      registered  mail under this section. This subdivision shall apply in the
      case of postmarks not made by the United States post office only if  and
      to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.
        (2)(A)  Any  reference  in  paragraph  one  of this subdivision to the
      United States mail shall be treated as  including  a  reference  to  any
      delivery  service  designated  by  the  secretary of the treasury of the
      United States pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the
      Internal  Revenue  Code  and  any  reference  in  paragraph  one of this
      subdivision to a postmark by the United States mail shall be treated  as
      including  a  reference  to  any  date  recorded or marked in the manner
      described in section seventy-five hundred two of  the  Internal  Revenue
      Code  by  a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of taxation
      and finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary
      is inadequate for the needs of the state, such commissioner may withdraw
      such designation for purposes of this  article.  Such  commissioner  may
      also  designate  additional  delivery  services  meeting the criteria of
      section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  for
      purposes  of  this article, or may withdraw any such designation if such
      commissioner finds that a delivery service so designated  is  inadequate
      for  the  needs  of  the  state.  Any reference in paragraph one of this
      subdivision to the United States mail shall be treated  as  including  a
      reference  to  any  delivery service designated by such commissioner and
      any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to a postmark by  the
      United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described in section seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  by  a  delivery  service
      designated by the commissioner.
        (B)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of taxation and finance pursuant to the same criteria used
      by the secretary for such designation pursuant to  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be included within the
      meaning of registered or certified mail as used in paragraph one of this
      subdivision.  If  such  commissioner  finds  that  any   equivalent   of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary or such
    
      commissioner is inadequate for the needs of the state, such commissioner
      may withdraw such designation for purposes of this article.
        (b)  Last  known  address.  For purposes of this chapter, a taxpayer's
      last known address shall be the address given in the last  return  filed
      by  such  taxpayer,  unless  subsequent to the filing of such return the
      taxpayer shall have notified the tax commission of a change of address.
        (c) Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When  the  last  day
      prescribed  under  authority of this chapter (including any extension of
      time) for performing any act falls  on  Saturday,  Sunday,  or  a  legal
      holiday  in  the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be
      considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is
      not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.
        (d) Certificate; unfiled return. For purposes  of  this  chapter,  the
      certificate  of the tax commission to the effect that a tax has not been
      paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been
      supplied, as required by or under the provisions of this chapter,  shall
      be  prima  facie  evidence  that  such  tax has not been paid, that such
      return has not been  filed,  or  that  such  information  has  not  been
      supplied.
        (e)  Attorney  general;  jurisdiction. The attorney general shall have
      concurrent jurisdiction with any district attorney in the prosecution of
      any offenses arising under article thirty-seven  of  the  tax  law  with
      respect to the tax imposed under this chapter.

Section 11-1792 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1792  Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The
      taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the tax  commission,
      and  it  may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount
      due it under this chapter if not otherwise specified. The tax commission
      shall, upon request, give a receipt for any  sum  collected  under  this
      chapter. The tax commission may authorize banks or trust companies which
      are  depositaries or financial agents of the state to receive and give a
      receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner,  at  such
      times,  and  under  such conditions as the tax commission may prescribe;
      and the tax commission shall prescribe the manner, times and  conditions
      under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is
      to be treated as payment of such tax to the tax commission.
        (b)  Notice  and  demand  for tax. The tax commission shall as soon as
      practicable give notice to each person liable for  any  amount  of  tax,
      addition  to  tax,  penalty  or  interest,  which  has been assessed but
      remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment  thereof.  Such
      notice  shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such
      person or shall be sent by mail to such  person's  last  known  address.
      Except  where  the  tax  commission  determines that collection would be
      jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed  prior  to  the  last  date
      (including  any  date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such
      tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.
        (c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person  liable
      under  this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty
      or interest neglects or  refuses  to  pay  the  same  within  twenty-one
      calendar  days  after notice and demand therefor is given to such person
      under subdivision (b) of this section (ten business days if  the  amount
      for  which  such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred
      thousand dollars), the commissioner of taxation and finance  may  within
      six  years  after the date of such assessment issue a warrant under such
      commissioner's official seal directed to the sheriff of  any  county  of
      the  state,  or to any officer or employee of the department of taxation
      and finance, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell  such  person's
      real  and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with
      the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such  warrant  to  such
      commissioner and pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof
      within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If such commissioner
      finds  that  the  collection  of the tax or other amount is in jeopardy,
      notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by  such
      commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount
      such  commissioner  may issue a warrant without regard to the twenty-one
      day  period  (or  ten-day  period  if  applicable)  provided   in   this
      subdivision.
        (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or
      officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this
      section  shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of
      the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the  judgment
      docket,  in  the  column  for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer
      mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the  tax  or  other
      amounts  for  which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is
      filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a lien upon the title  to  and
      interest in real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. Such lien
      shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed in the
      department of state.
        (e)  Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the
      tax commission shall, in the right  of  the  city,  be  deemed  to  have
      obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.
    
        (f)  Execution.  The  sheriff  or  officer or employee shall thereupon
      proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, and  in  the
      same  manner  prescribed  by law in respect to executions issued against
      property upon judgments of a court of record, and  a  sheriff  shall  be
      entitled  to  the  same  fees  for  his or her services in executing the
      warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or  employee  of
      the  department  of  taxation  and  finance may proceed in any county or
      counties of this state and  shall  have  all  the  powers  of  execution
      conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in  connection  with  the
      execution of the warrant.
        (g)  Taxpayer  not  a  resident.  Where  a  notice  and  demand  under
      subdivision (b) of this section shall have been given to a taxpayer  who
      is  not then a resident, and it appears to the tax commission that it is
      not  practicable  to  find  in  this  state  property  of  the  taxpayer
      sufficient  to  pay  the  entire balance of tax or other amount owing by
      such taxpayer who is not then a resident, the  tax  commission  may,  in
      accordance  with  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section,  issue  a warrant
      directed to an officer or employee of the  department  of  taxation  and
      finance,  a  copy  of  which  warrant  shall  be  mailed by certified or
      registered mail to the taxpayer  at  his  or  her  last  known  address,
      subject  to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section
      11-1781. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee  to  proceed
      in Albany county, and he or she shall, within five days after receipt of
      the  warrant,  file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with
      this section. Thereupon the tax commission may authorize the institution
      of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the  judgment  in  any
      place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of
      the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The tax commission
      may  also, in its discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the
      purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid  taxes,
      additions  to  tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under
      this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents of this state,  may
      fix  the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money
      appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for  payment  thereof,  and
      may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance
      of  their  duties, in such form and in such amount as the tax commission
      shall deem proper and sufficient.
        (h) Action by state for recovery of taxes. Action may  be  brought  by
      the  attorney  general at the instance of the tax commission in the name
      of the city or both to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions
      to tax, penalties or  interest  which  have  been  assessed  under  this
      chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced.
        (i)  Release  of  lien.  The  tax  commission,  if  it  finds that the
      interests of the city will not thereby be  jeopardized,  and  upon  such
      conditions  as it may require, may release any property from the lien of
      any warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties  and  interest
      filed  pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the
      office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1793
---------------

Section 11-1793 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1793  Transferees.  (a)  General.  The  liability,  at law or in
      equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions
      to tax, penalty or interest due under this chapter, shall  be  assessed,
      paid,  and  collected  in  the  same  manner  and  subject  to  the same
      provisions and limitations as in the  case  of  the  tax  to  which  the
      liability  relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment
      against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive
      transfer, in  order,  from  the  original  taxpayer  to  the  transferee
      involved,  but  not  by more than three years in the aggregate. The term
      transferee includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee.
        (b) Exceptions.
        (1) If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of  limitations  for
      assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the
      tax  commission  in  any court against the original taxpayer or the last
      preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original  taxpayer,
      then  the  period  of  limitation  for  assessment  of  liability of the
      transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after  such  claim
      has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.
        (2)  If,  before  the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision
      (a) or the immediately preceding paragraph of this subdivision  for  the
      assessment  of the liability, the tax commission and the transferee have
      both consented in  writing  to  its  assessment  after  such  time,  the
      liability  may  be  assessed  at any time prior to the expiration of the
      period agreed upon. The  period  so  agreed  upon  may  be  extended  by
      subsequent  agreements  in  writing  made  before  the expiration of the
      period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period
      of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of  overpayments  of
      tax  made  by  such  transferee  or  overpayments  of  tax  made  by the
      transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to  credit  or
      refund,  such  agreement  and  any  extension thereof shall be deemed an
      agreement and extension  thereof  referred  to  in  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-1787.  If  the agreement is executed after the expiration of
      the period of limitation for assessment against the  original  taxpayer,
      then  in  applying  the  limitations  under  subdivision  (b) of section
      11-1787 on the amount of the credit or refund, the periods specified  in
      subdivision (a) of section 11-1787 shall be increased by the period from
      the date of such expiration to the date of the agreement.
        (c)  Deceased  transferor.  If  any  person is deceased, the period of
      limitation for assessment against such person shall be the  period  that
      would be in effect if he or she had lived.
        (d)  Evidence.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision (e) of
      section 11-1797  the  tax  commission  shall  use  its  powers  to  make
      available  to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the transferee
      to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding
      transferees, but without undue hardship  to  the  original  taxpayer  or
      preceding transferee. See subdivision (e) of section 11-1789 for rule as
      to burden of proof.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1794
---------------

Section 11-1794 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1794  Jeopardy  assessment. (a) Authority for making. If the tax
      commission believes that the assessment or collection  of  a  deficiency
      will  be  jeopardized by delay, it shall, notwithstanding the provisions
      of sections 11-1781 and  11-1796,  immediately  assess  such  deficiency
      (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for
      by  law),  and notice and demand shall be made by the tax commission for
      the payment thereof.
        (b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment  is  made  before
      any  notice  in  respect  of  the  tax  to which the jeopardy assessment
      relates has been mailed under section 11-1781, then the  tax  commission
      shall  mail  a  notice  under  such  section within sixty days after the
      making of the assessment.
        (c) Amount assessable before decision of tax commission. The  jeopardy
      assessment  may  be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than
      that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether  or  not  the
      taxpayer  has  theretofore filed a petition with the tax commission. The
      tax commission may, at any time before  rendering  its  decision,  abate
      such  assessment,  or  any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that it
      believes the assessment to be excessive in amount.  The  tax  commission
      may  in its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and
      of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
        (d) Amount  assessable  after  decision  of  tax  commission.  If  the
      jeopardy  assessment is made after the decision of the tax commission is
      rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the  deficiency
      determined by the tax commission in its decision.
        (e)  Expiration  of  right to assess. A jeopardy assessment may not be
      made after the decision of the tax commission has become final or  after
      the  taxpayer  has made an application for review of the decision of the
      tax commission.
        (f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed  with
      the  tax  commission and when the amount which should have been assessed
      has been determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become
      final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been  stayed
      by  bond,  shall  be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand
      from the tax commission, and any remaining  portion  of  the  assessment
      shall  be  abated.  If  the  amount already collected exceeds the amount
      determined as the amount which should have been  assessed,  such  excess
      shall  be  credited  or  refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section
      11-1786 without the filing of claim therefor. If the  amount  determined
      as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount
      actually  assessed,  then  the difference shall be assessed and shall be
      collected as part of the  tax  upon  notice  and  demand  from  the  tax
      commission.
        (g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The tax commission may abate
      the  jeopardy  assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such
      abatement may not be made after a decision  of  the  tax  commission  in
      respect  of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed
      with the tax commission, after the expiration of the period  for  filing
      such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and
      levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall
      be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made,
      except  that  the running of such period shall in any event be suspended
      for the period from the date  of  such  jeopardy  assessment  until  the
      expiration  of  the  tenth  day  after  the  day  on which such jeopardy
      assessment is abated.
        (h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount
      of any jeopardy  assessment  may  be  stayed  by  filing  with  the  tax
      commission, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an
    
      amount  equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned
      upon the payment of the amount  (together  with  interest  thereon)  the
      collection  of  which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making
      of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of
      the  bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered
      by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to  waive
      such  stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount
      covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part  of  the
      amount  covered  by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request
      of the taxpayer, be proportionately  reduced.  If  any  portion  of  the
      jeopardy  assessment  is  abated,  or  if  a  notice of deficiency under
      section 11-1781 is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount,  the  bond
      shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.
        (i)  Petition  to  tax  commission.  If  the  bond is given before the
      taxpayer has filed his or her petition under section 11-1789,  the  bond
      shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within
      the  period provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of
      which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and  demand  at  any
      time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon
      from  the  date  of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice
      and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall  be  conditioned  upon
      the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed
      by  the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the tax commission which
      has become final. If the  tax  commission  determines  that  the  amount
      assessed  is  greater  than  the amount which should have been assessed,
      then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be  proportionately
      reduced when the decision of the tax commission is rendered.
        (j)  Stay  of sale of seized property pending tax commission decision.
      Where a jeopardy  assessment  is  made,  the  property  seized  for  the
      collection of the tax shall not be sold:
        (1)  if  subdivision  (b)  of this section is applicable, prior to the
      issuance of the notice of deficiency and  the  expiration  of  the  time
      provided  in  section  11-1789  for  filing  a  petition  with  the  tax
      commission, and
        (2) if a petition is filed with the tax commission (whether before  or
      after  the  making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the expiration
      of the period during which the assessment of  the  deficiency  would  be
      prohibited  if subdivision (a) of this section were not applicable. Such
      property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if the tax
      commission determines that the expenses of conservation and  maintenance
      will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.
        (k)  Interest.  For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-1784,
      the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without  regard
      to  any notice and demand for payment issued under this section prior to
      the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.
        (l) Early termination of taxable year. If  the  tax  commission  finds
      that  a  taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove
      his or her property therefrom, or to conceal himself or herself  or  his
      or  her property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or
      to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect  the  city
      personal income tax for the current or the preceding taxable year unless
      such  proceedings  be  brought  without  delay, the tax commission shall
      declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and
      shall cause notice of such finding  and  declaration  to  be  given  the
      taxpayer,  together  with  a demand for immediate payment of the tax for
      the taxable period so  declared  terminated  and  of  the  tax  for  the
      preceding  taxable  year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or
      not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and  paying  the
    
      tax  has  expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due
      and payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes  made
      due  and  payable  by  virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the
      finding  of  the  tax  commission  made as herein provided, whether made
      after notice  to  the  taxpayer  or  not,  shall  be  for  all  purposes
      presumptive evidence of jeopardy.
        (m)  Reopening  of  taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of
      the taxable period of the taxpayer by the tax commission, as provided in
      subdivision (1), the tax commission may reopen such taxable period  each
      time  the  taxpayer  is  found  by  the  tax commission to have received
      income, within the current taxable year, since the termination  of  such
      period.  A  taxable  period  so  terminated by the tax commission may be
      reopened by the taxpayer if he or she files with the  tax  commission  a
      true  and  accurate  return  of taxable income and credits allowed under
      this  chapter  for  such  taxable  period,  together  with  such   other
      information as the tax commission may by regulations prescribe.
        (n)  Furnishing  of  bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed by the tax
      commission. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced  by  any  proceedings
      under  the  provisions  of  subdivision (1) of this section prior to the
      expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such  taxes  if  the
      taxpayer  furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the tax commission,
      a bond to insure the timely making  of  returns  with  respect  to,  and
      payment  of,  such  taxes  or  any  city personal income taxes for prior
      years.

        §  11-1796  Income  taxes  of  members  of armed forces and victims of
      certain terrorist attacks.  (a) Time to be disregarded. In the  case  of
      an  individual  serving  in  the  armed  forces of the United States, or
      serving in support of such armed forces, in an area  designated  by  the
      president  of the United States by executive order as a "combat zone" at
      any time during the period designated  by  the  president  by  executive
      order   as   the  period  of  combatant  activities  in  such  zone,  or
      hospitalized inside or outside the state as a result of injury  received
      while serving in such an area during such time, the period of service in
      such  area,  plus  the  period  of  continuous hospitalization inside or
      outside the state attributable to such injury, and the next one  hundred
      eighty  days thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this
      chapter, in respect of the city personal income tax liability (including
      any interest, penalty, or addition to the tax) of such individual:
        (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed  within  the  time
      prescribed therefor:
        (A) filing any return of income tax (except withholding tax);
        (B)  payment  of  any  income  tax  (except  withholding  tax)  or any
      installment thereof or of any other liability in respect thereof;
        (C) filing a petition with the tax commission for credit or refund  or
      for  redetermination  of  a  deficiency,  or application for review of a

        (e)  Treatment  of  individuals performing Desert Shield services. (1)
      Any individual who performed Desert Shield services shall be entitled to
      the benefits of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this  section  in  the  same
      manner  as if such services were services referred to in subdivision (a)

        (2)  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term  "Desert  Shield
      services" means any services in the armed forces of the United States or
      in support of such armed forces if
        (A)  such  services  are  performed  in  the  area  designated  by the
      president of the United States as the "Persian Gulf Desert Shield area",

Section 11-1797
---------------

Section 11-1797 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1797  General  powers  of  tax  commission. (a) General. The tax
      commission shall administer and enforce the tax imposed by this  chapter
      and  it is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require
      such facts and information to be reported, as it may deem  necessary  to
      enforce the provisions of this chapter.
        (b) Examination of books and witnesses. (1) The tax commission for the
      purpose  of  ascertaining  the  correctness  of  any  return, or for the
      purpose of making an estimate of taxable income  of  any  person,  shall
      have  power  to  examine  or  to cause to have examined, by any agent or
      representative designated by it for that  purpose,  any  books,  papers,
      records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in
      the  return,  and may require the attendance of the person rendering the
      return or any officer or employee of such person, or the  attendance  of
      any  other  person  having  knowledge  in  the  premises,  and  may take
      testimony and require proof material for its information, with power  to
      administer oaths to such person or persons.
        (2) The tax commission may take any action under paragraph one of this
      subdivision to inquire into the commission of any offense connected with
      the  administration  or  enforcement of this chapter, provided, however,
      that notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-1774 of  this  chapter
      no  such action shall be taken after a referral by the department or the
      tax commission to the attorney general, a district attorney or any other
      prosecutorial agency is in effect.
        (c) Abatement authority. The tax commission, of its  own  motion,  may
      abate  any small unpaid balance of an assessment of city personal income
      tax, or  any  liability  in  respect  thereof,  if  the  tax  commission
      determines  under uniform rules prescribed by it that the administration
      and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount
      due. It may also abate, of its own motion, the  unpaid  portion  of  the
      assessment  of  any  tax  or  any liability in respect thereof, which is
      excessive in amount, or is assessed after the expiration of  the  period
      of   limitation  properly  applicable  thereto,  or  is  erroneously  or
      illegally assessed. No claim for abatement under this subdivision  shall
      be filed by a taxpayer.
        (d)  Special  refund  authority. Where no questions of fact or law are
      involved and it appears from the records of the tax commission that  any
      moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or
      other  person,  or paid by such taxpayer or other person under a mistake
      of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the tax commission
      at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the
      power, upon making a record of its reasons therefor in writing, to cause
      such moneys so paid and being  erroneously  and  illegally  held  to  be
      refunded and to issue therefor its certificate to the comptroller.
        (e)  Secrecy  requirement  and  penalties for violation. (1) Except in
      accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided  by  law,
      it  shall  be unlawful for the tax commission, any tax commissioner, any
      officer or employee of the  department  of  taxation  and  finance,  any
      person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract
      basis,  any  depositary to which any return may be delivered as provided
      in subdivision (h) or (i) of this section, any officer  or  employee  of
      such  depositary,  or  any  person  who,  pursuant  to  this section, is
      permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a copy, an abstract
      or a portion of any report or  return  is  furnished,  or  to  whom  any
      information  contained  in any report or return is furnished, to divulge
      or make known in any manner the amount of income or any particulars  set
      forth or disclosed in any report or return required under this chapter.
        (2)  The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns
      shall not be required to produce any of them  or  evidence  of  anything
    
      contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
      behalf of the tax commission  in  an  action  or  proceeding  under  the
      provisions  of  this  chapter,  the  tax  law  or in any other action or
      proceeding  involving  the collection of a tax due under this chapter or
      such tax law to which the city, state or the tax commission is  a  party
      or  a  claimant,  or  on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding
      under the provisions of this chapter when the reports, returns or  facts
      shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any
      of  which  events the court may require the production of, and may admit
      in evidence, so much of said reports, returns  or  of  the  facts  shown
      thereby,  as  are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The
      tax commission may, nevertheless, publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any
      decision rendered after the hearing required under section 11-1789.
        (3)  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery by the
      state commissioner of taxation and finance to  the  county  clerk  of  a
      county  within  the city of New York of a mailing list of individuals to
      whom income tax forms are mailed by the state commissioner  of  taxation
      and  finance  for  the  sole  purpose of compiling a list of prospective
      jurors as provided in article sixteen of the  judiciary  law.  Provided,
      however,  such  delivery  shall only be made pursuant to an order of the
      chief administrator of the courts, appointed  pursuant  to  section  two
      hundred  ten  of such law. No such order may be issued unless such chief
      administrator is satisfied that such mailing list is needed to compile a
      proper list of prospective jurors for the county for which such order is
      sought and that, in view of the responsibilities imposed by the  various
      laws  of  the  state  on  the  department of taxation and finance, it is
      reasonable to require the state commissioner of taxation and finance  to
      furnish such list. Such order shall provide that such list shall be used
      for  the sole purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors and that
      such county clerk shall take all necessary steps to insure that the list
      is kept confidential and that there is no unauthorized use or disclosure
      of such list. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
      the delivery to a taxpayer or his or her duly authorized  representative
      of a certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with his
      or her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as
      to  prevent  the identification of particular reports or returns and the
      items thereof, or the inspection by the attorney general or other  legal
      representatives  of  the  state  or  city of the report or return of any
      taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or  review  the  tax  based
      thereon,  or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter has
      been recommended by  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance,  the
      corporation  counsel  or the attorney general or has been instituted, or
      the inspection of the reports or returns required under this chapter  by
      the  comptroller  or  duly  designated  officer or employee of the state
      department of audit and control, for purposes of the audit of  a  refund
      of  any  tax paid by a taxpayer under this chapter, or the furnishing to
      the state department of social services of the amount of an  overpayment
      of  tax and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited
      against past-due support pursuant to section one  hundred  seventy-one-c

      taxpayer who made such overpayment or the furnishing  to  the  New  York
      state  higher  education  services  corporation  of  the  amount  of  an
      overpayment of tax and interest thereon certified to the comptroller  to
      be credited against the amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed
      student  loan  pursuant  to section one hundred seventy-one-d of the tax
      law and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who  made
      such  overpayment  or the furnishing to the state university of New York
      or the city university of New York or the attorney general on behalf  of
    
      such  state  or  city university the amount of an overpayment of tax and

      amount of a default in repayment of a  state  university  loan  or  city
      university loan pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-e of the tax
      law  and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made
      such overpayment, or the disclosing  to  a  state  agency,  pursuant  to
      section  one  hundred  seventy-one-f of the tax law, of the amount of an
      overpayment and interest thereon certified  to  the  comptroller  to  be
      credited against a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to such agency
      and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such
      overpayment,  or  the  disclosing  to the commissioner of finance of the
      city of New York, pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-1  of  the
      tax  law, of the amount of an overpayment and interest thereon certified
      to the comptroller to be credited against a city of New York tax warrant
      judgment debt and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer
      who made such overpayment. Reports and returns shall  be  preserved  for
      three  years and thereafter until the state commissioner of taxation and
      finance orders them to be destroyed.
        (3-a)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  one  of   this
      subdivision,  the  state  commissioner  of  taxation  and finance or the
      commissioner of finance may disclose  to  a  taxpayer  or  a  taxpayer's

      chapter,  information relating to any royalty paid, incurred or received
      by such taxpayer or related member to or from the other,  including  the
      treatment  of such payments by the taxpayer or the related member in any
      report or return transmitted to the state commissioner of  taxation  and
      finance  under  this  chapter  or  the  New  York  state  tax law or the
      commissioner of finance under this title.
        (4) (A) Any officer or employee of the state, who  willfully  violates
      the provisions of this subdivision shall be dismissed from office and be
      incapable  of  holding  any  public office in this state for a period of
      five years thereafter.

      of the tax law.
        (f)   Cooperation   with   the   United   States   and  other  states.

      tax  commission  may  permit the secretary of the treasury of the United
      States or his or her delegates, or the proper tax officer of  any  state
      imposing  an  income  tax  upon  the  incomes  of  individuals,  or  the
      authorized representative of either such officer, to inspect any  return
      filed  under  this chapter, or may furnish to such officer or his or her
      authorized representative an abstract of any such return or  supply  him
      or her with information concerning an item contained in any such return,
      or  disclosed  by any investigation of tax liability under this chapter,
      but such permission shall be granted or such  information  furnished  to
      such officer or his or her representative only if the laws of the United
      States  or  of such other state, as the case may be, grant substantially
      similar privileges to the commission or officer of  this  state  charged
      with  the  administration  of  the  tax imposed by this chapter and such
      information is to be used for tax purposes only;  and  provided  further
      the commissioner of taxation and finance may furnish to the commissioner
      of internal revenue or his or her authorized representative such returns
      filed  under  this  chapter  and other tax information, as he or she may
      consider proper, for use in  court  actions  or  proceedings  under  the
      internal  revenue  code,  whether  civil  or  criminal,  where a written
      request therefor has been made  to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
      finance  by the secretary of the treasury of the United States or his or
      her  delegates,  provided  the  laws  of   the   United   States   grant
    
      substantially  similar  powers  to  the secretary of the treasury of the
      United States or  his  or  her  delegates.  Where  the  commissioner  of
      taxation  and  finance  has  so  authorized  use  of  returns  and other

      liability  under  this  chapter, but such permission shall be granted or
      such information furnished to such officer or his or her  representative
      only  if  the  local  laws  of  such  city  grant  substantially similar
      privileges to the commission or officer of this state charged  with  the
      administration  of  the tax imposed by this chapter and such information
      is  to  be  used  for  tax  purposes  only;  and  provided  further  the
      commissioner of taxation and finance may furnish to such city officer or
      the  legal  representative  of  such  city such returns filed under this
      chapter and other tax information, as he or she may consider proper, for
      use in court actions or proceedings under such local law, whether  civil
      or  criminal,  where  a  written  request  therefor has been made to the
      commissioner of taxation and finance by such city officer or his or  her
      delegate,  provided  the  local  law  of  such city grants substantially
      similar powers to such city officer or his or her  delegate.  Where  the
      commissioner  of  taxation  and finance has so authorized use of returns
      and other information in  such  actions  or  proceedings,  officers  and
      employees  of the department of taxation and finance may testify in such
      actions or proceedings in respect to such returns or other information.
        (h) Withholding returns. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision
      (e) of this section the tax commission in its  discretion,  when  making
      deposits,  pursuant  to section 11-1798, of taxes withheld by employers,
      may deliver to the depositary the  withholding  returns  filed  by  such
      employers  as  provided  in section 11-1774, for the purpose of insuring
      that all money so deposited shall be correctly  credited  to  taxpayers'
      accounts.
        (i)   Filing   returns   and  making  payments  to  depository  banks.
      Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (e) of this  section,  the
      tax  commission,  in  its  discretion,  may require or permit any or all
      individuals, estates or trusts  liable  for  any  tax  imposed  by  this
      chapter, to make payments on account of estimated tax and payment of any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest  imposed  by  this chapter to banks, banking
      houses or trust companies designated by the tax commission and  to  file
      reports  and  returns with such banks, banking houses or trust companies
      as agents of the tax commission, in lieu of making any such  payment  to
      the  tax  commission.  However,  the tax commission shall designate only
      such banks, banking houses  or  trust  companies  as  are  or  shall  be
      designated  by  the  comptroller  as  depositories  pursuant  to section
      11-1798.
        (j) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of  taxation
      and finance shall set the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest
      to  be  paid  pursuant  to sections 11-1784, 11-1785 and 11-1788 of this
      subchapter, but if no such rates of interest are set,  such  overpayment
    
      rate  shall  be  deemed  to  be  set  at  six  percent per annum and the
      underpayment rate shall be deemed  to  be  set  at  seven  and  one-half
      percent  per  annum.  Such  rates  shall  be  the  rates  prescribed  by
      paragraphs  two  and four of this subdivision, but the underpayment rate
      shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per  annum.  Any  such
      rates  set  by  such  commissioner  shall apply to taxes, or any portion
      thereof, which remain or become due or overpaid on or after the date  on
      which  such  rates become effective and shall apply only with respect to
      interest computed or computable  for  periods  or  portions  of  periods
      occurring in the period during which such rates are in effect.
        (2)  Rates  of interest. (A) Overpayment rate. The overpayment rate of
      interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the  federal
      short-term  rate  as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision,
      plus (ii) two percentage points.
        (B) Underpayment rate. The underpayment rate  of  interest  set  under
      this  subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as
      provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii)  five  and
      one-half percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For the purposes of this subdivision:
        (A)  The  federal  short-term  rate for any month shall be the federal
      short-term rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  the
      treasury  during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section
      twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
      connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
      internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest
      full  percent  (or,  if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i) In general. Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii)  of  this
      subparagraph,  the  federal  short-term rate for the first month in each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii) Special rule for individual estimated  tax.  In  determining  the
      addition  to tax under subdivision (c) of section 11-1785 for failure to
      pay estimated tax for any taxable  year,  the  federal  short-term  rate
      which  applies  during  the third month following the taxable year shall
      also apply during the first fifteen days of the fourth  month  following
      such taxable year.
        (iii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September, nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision to the contrary, in the  case  of  interest  payable  by  an
      employer  with  respect to income taxes required to be withheld and paid
      over by him or her pursuant to the provisions of subchapter four of this
      chapter and with respect to interest payable to an employer pursuant  to
      subdivision  (c) of section 11-1786, the rates of interest prescribed by
      this section shall be the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest
      prescribed in paragraph two of subsection (e) of  section  one  thousand
      ninety-six of the tax law.
        (5)  In computing the amount of any interest required to be paid under
      this article by the commissioner of  taxation  and  finance  or  by  the
      taxpayer,  or any other amount determined by reference to such amount of
      interest, such interest and such amount shall be compounded  daily.  The
      preceding  sentence shall not apply for purposes of computing the amount
    
      of  any  addition  to  tax  for  failure  to  pay  estimated  tax  under
      subdivision (c) of section 11-1785.
        (6)  Publication  of  interest rates. The commissioner of taxation and
      finance shall cause to be published in  the  section  for  miscellaneous
      notices in the state register, and give other appropriate general notice
      of,  the  interest  rates to be set under this subdivision no later than
      twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which
      such interest rates apply. The setting and publication of such  interest
      rates  shall  not be included within paragraph (a) of subdivision two of
      section one hundred  two  of  the  state  administrative  procedure  act
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        (7)  Cross-reference.  For  provisions  relating  to  the power of the
      commissioner of taxation and finance to abate small amounts of interest,
      see subdivision (c) of this section.
        (k) Disclosure of collection activities with respect to joint  return.
      Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of subdivision (e) of this section, if
      any deficiency of tax with respect to a joint return is assessed and the
      individuals filing such return are no longer married or no longer reside
      in the same household,  upon  request  in  writing  by  either  of  such
      individuals,  the commissioner of taxation and finance shall disclose in
      writing to the individual making the request whether  such  commissioner
      has attempted to collect such deficiency from such other individual, the
      general  nature of such collection activities, and the amount collected.
      The preceding sentence shall not apply to any deficiency which  may  not
      be  collected  by  reason  of expiration of time within which to issue a
      warrant under subdivision (c) of section 11-1792 of this title or within
      which to collect such tax by execution and levy or by court proceeding.
        (l) Disclosure of certain information where more than  one  person  is
      subject  to  penalty.  If  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
      determines that a person is liable for a penalty under  subdivision  (g)
      of  section  11-1785  of  this  title  with respect to any failure, upon
      request in writing of such person, such commissioner shall  disclose  in
      writing  to  such  person  (1)  the  name  of any other person whom such
      commissioner has determined to be liable for such penalty  with  respect
      to  such  failure,  and  (2)  whether such commissioner has attempted to
      collect such penalty from such other person, the general nature of  such
      collection activities, and the amount collected.

      collected  the preceding calendar month. The amounts so payable shall be
      certified to the state comptroller by the state commissioner of taxation
      and finance or his or her delegate, either of whom  shall  not  be  held
      liable  for any inaccuracy in such certificate. Where the amount so paid
      over to such chief fiscal officer is more or less than the  amount  then
      due  such  city,  the  amount  of  overpayment  or underpayment shall be
      certified to the state comptroller by the state commissioner of taxation
      and finance or his or her delegate, either of whom  shall  not  be  held
      liable for any inaccuracy in such certificate. The amount of overpayment

      after the discovery of the overpayment  or  underpayment  as  reasonably
      possible  and subsequent payments by the state comptroller to such chief
      fiscal officer shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of  any  such
      overpayment  from,  or  by adding the amount of any such underpayment to
      such number of  subsequent  payments  and  distributions  as  the  state
      comptroller  and  the  state  commissioner of taxation and finance shall
      consider reasonable  in  view  of  the  amount  of  the  overpayment  or
      underpayment and all other facts and circumstances.

        § 11-1800 Enforcement with other taxes. (a) If there is assessed a tax
      under this chapter and there is also assessed a tax or taxes against the
      same  taxpayer  pursuant  to  article twenty-two of the tax law or under
      chapter nineteen of this title and if the tax  commission  takes  action
      under  such  article  twenty-two  or  under  such  chapter nineteen with
      respect to the enforcement and collection of the tax or  taxes  assessed
      under  such  articles and/or chapter, the tax commission shall, wherever
      possible, accompany such action with  a  similar  action  under  similar
      enforcement and collection provisions of this chapter.
        (b)  Any  moneys  collected  as a result of such joint action shall be
      deemed to  have  been  collected  in  proportion  to  the  amounts  due,
      including  tax,  penalties, interest and additions to tax, under article
      twenty-two of the tax law and this city income tax.
        (c) Whenever the tax commission takes any action  with  respect  to  a
      deficiency  of  income tax under article twenty-two of such law or under
      chapter nineteen of this title, other  than  the  action  set  forth  in

Section 11-1801 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1801  Administration,  collection  and  review.  (a)  Except  as
      otherwise provided in this chapter, any  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter
      shall  be  administered  and collected by the tax commission in the same
      manner as the tax imposed by  article  twenty-two  of  the  tax  law  is
      administered  and  collected by such commission. Whenever there is joint
      collection of state and city personal income taxes, it shall  be  deemed
      that  such  collections  shall  represent proportionately the applicable
      state and city personal income taxes in determining  the  amount  to  be
      remitted to the city.
        (b)  The  tax commission, in its discretion, may require or permit any
      or all persons liable for any  tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  to  make
      payments  on account of estimated tax and payment of any tax, penalty or
      interest to such banks, banking houses or trust companies designated  by
      the  tax  commission and to file returns with such banks, banking houses
      or trust companies, as agent of the tax commission, in lieu of paying  a
      tax imposed by this chapter directly to the tax commission. However, the
      tax  commission shall designate only such banks, banking houses or trust
      companies which are designated by the comptroller as depositories of the
      state.
        (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions  of  this  chapter,  the  tax
      commission may require:
        (1) the filing of any or all of the following:
        (A) a combined return which, in addition to the return provided for in
      section 11-1751, may also include any or both of the returns required to
      be  filed  by  a  resident  individual of New York state pursuant to the
      provisions of section six hundred fifty-one of the tax law and which may
      be required to be filed by such individual pursuant to chapter  nineteen
      of this title and
        (B)  a combined employer's return which, in addition to the employer's
      return provided for by this chapter, may also include any or both of the
      employer's returns required to be filed by the same employer pursuant to
      the provisions of section six  hundred  seventy-four  of  such  law  and
      required  to be filed by such employer pursuant to such chapter nineteen
      of this title and
        (2) where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with
      respect to the payment of estimated tax, the  tax  commission  may  also
      require the payment to it of a single amount which shall equal the total
      of  the  amounts  which  would  have  been  required to be paid with the
      returns or employer's returns or in payment of estimated tax pursuant to
      the provisions of article twenty-two of such tax law, and the provisions
      of this chapter as if no  combined  return  or  employer's  return  were
