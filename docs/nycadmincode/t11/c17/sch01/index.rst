      thousand  two  and  before  two  thousand six, there is hereby imposed a
      supplemental tax, in addition to  the  tax  imposed  under  the  opening
      paragraph of this section, for the purpose of recapturing the benefit of
      the  tax  tables  contained  in  subdivision  (g)  of  this section. The
      supplemental tax shall be an amount equal to the sum of  the  tax  table
      benefits  in  paragraphs  one  and two of this subdivision multiplied by
      their respective fractions in such paragraphs  provided,  however,  that
      paragraph  one  of this subdivision shall not apply to taxpayers who are
      not subject to the second highest rate of tax.
        (1) Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns,  surviving
      spouses,  resident  heads of households, resident unmarried individuals,
      resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
      estates  and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference between
      (i) the amount  of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax  table  in
      subdivision  (g)  of this section not subject to the second highest rate
      of tax for the taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the  second
      highest  dollar  denominated  tax  for such amount of taxable income set
      forth in the tax table applicable to the taxable year in subdivision (g)
      of this section.
        (B) The fraction is computed as follows: the numerator is  the  lesser
      of  fifty  thousand  dollars  or  the  excess of New York adjusted gross
      income for the taxable year over one hundred fifty thousand dollars  and
      the denominator is fifty thousand dollars.
        (C)  This  paragraph shall only apply to taxable years beginning after
      two thousand two and before two thousand six.
        (2) Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns,  surviving
      spouses,  resident  heads of households, resident unmarried individuals,
      resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
      estates  and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference between
      (i) the amount  of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax  table  in
      subdivision  (g)  of this section not subject to the highest rate of tax
      for the taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the highest dollar
      denominated tax for such amount of taxable income set forth in  the  tax
      table  applicable to the taxable year in subdivision (g) of this section
      less the sum of  the  tax  table  benefits  in  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision.
        (B)  For  such  taxpayers with adjusted gross income over five hundred
      thousand dollars, the fraction is one. Provided, however, that the total
      tax prior to the application of any tax credits  shall  not  exceed  the
      highest  rate  of  tax  set forth in the tax table in subdivision (g) of
      this section multiplied by the taxpayer's taxable income.
    
        (C) This paragraph shall only apply to taxable years  beginning  after
      two thousand two and before two thousand six.

      ninety-two,   nineteen   hundred   ninety-four   and   nineteen  hundred
      ninety-five,  and   by   September   fifteenth   of   nineteen   hundred
      ninety-three,  transmit  to  the  commissioner of taxation and finance a
      certification setting forth the percentage of non-achievement  regarding
      the  combined police uniformed staffing level with respect to the fiscal
      year of the city ending on the  immediately  preceding  June  thirtieth,
      provided,  however,  that  for  the  city fiscal year ending in nineteen
      hundred  ninety-three  the  percentage  of  non-achievement   shall   be
      determined  by  the combined police uniformed staffing level existing on
      August thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-three,  and  further  provided
      for  all  such fiscal years that the percentage of non-achievement shall
      be calculated according to the procedure specified in  a  memorandum  of
      understanding  relating  to  the  New  York  city safe streets-safe city
      program  and  to  the  enactment  of  this  subdivision  dated  February
      eleventh,  nineteen  hundred ninety-one, as amended, and executed by the
      governor, the temporary president of the state senate,  the  speaker  of
      the  state  assembly,  the  minority  leader  of  the  state senate, the
      minority leader of the state assembly, the mayor and the speaker of  the
      city  council,  any any modification of such memorandum of understanding
      subsequently agreed upon by all such signatories in a single  subsequent
      memorandum  of  understanding.  If such percentage of non-achievement is
      equal to or exceeds twenty-five percent with respect to the fiscal  year
      of  the  city  of New York ending in nineteen hundred ninety-two, twenty
      percent with respect to the city fiscal year ending in nineteen  hundred
      ninety-three  or  five  percent  with  respect  to the city fiscal years
      ending in nineteen hundred ninety-four and nineteen hundred ninety-five,
      then the rates of the tax surcharge imposed by this section for  taxable
      years  beginning  in  the  calendar year beginning on January first next
      succeeding such  August  first  or  September  fifteenth  shall  be  the
      products of the rates set forth in subdivision (b) of this section and a
      percentage  equal to the difference between one hundred percent and such
      percentage of non-achievement, such products  computed  to  the  nearest
      hundredth  of  a  percent, and the dollar denominated amounts of the tax
      surcharge set forth in subdivision (b) of this section shall be  reduced
      conformably.
        (2)  Notwithstanding  subdivision (b) of this section, with respect to
      the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-eight,  the  mayor
      shall, by August first of nineteen hundred ninety-seven, transmit to the
      state commissioner of taxation and finance a certification setting forth
      the   percentage  of  non-achievement  regarding  the  police  uniformed
      staffing level with respect to the fiscal year ending on the immediately
      preceding June thirtieth, provided, however,  that  such  percentage  of
      non-achievement shall be calculated according to the procedure specified
      in  a  new memorandum of understanding relating to the enactment of this
      paragraph dated no later than  thirty  days  after  such  enactment,  as
      executed  by  the  governor,  the temporary president of the senate, the
      speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of the senate, the minority
      leader of the assembly, the mayor and the speaker of  the  city  council
      and   any   modifications   of  such  new  memorandum  of  understanding
      subsequently agreed upon by all such signatories in a single  subsequent
      memorandum  of  understanding.  If  such  percentage  of non-achievement
    
      exceeds two percent with respect to the fiscal year of the  city  ending
      in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven, then the rates of the tax surcharge
      authorized by this section  for  the  taxable  years  beginning  in  the
      calendar  year beginning on January first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight
      shall be the products of the rates set forth in subdivision (b) of  this
      section  and  a  percentage  equal to the difference between one hundred
      percent and the portion of the percentage of non-achievement that is  in
      excess  of  two percent, such products computed to the nearest hundredth
      of a percent, and the dollar denominated amounts of  the  tax  surcharge
      set   forth  in  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section  shall  be  reduced
      conformably.
        (3) If the rates of the surcharge imposed by this section are modified
      pursuant to paragraph one or paragraph  two  of  this  subdivision,  the
      state  commissioner of taxation and finance shall promulgate regulations
      stating the modified rates.
        (e) Notwithstanding anything in this section  or  section  11-1798  of
      this  chapter  to the contrary, of the total revenue (including interest
      and penalties) from the tax surcharge imposed by this section which  the
      state  comptroller  is  required  to pay, after June thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred ninety-two, to the chief fiscal officer of the city for  payment
      into  the  treasury of the city, one hundred ten million dollars thereof
      paid to the chief fiscal officer during the  fiscal  year  of  the  city
      commencing  July first, nineteen hundred ninety-two, two hundred million
      dollars thereof paid to the chief fiscal officer during the fiscal  year
      of  the  city  commencing July first, nineteen hundred ninety-three, one
      hundred sixty-seven million dollars thereof paid  to  the  chief  fiscal
      officer  during  the  fiscal  year  of  the  city commencing July first,
      nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  and  one  hundred  eighty-five  million
      dollars  thereof paid to the chief fiscal officer during the fiscal year
      of the city commencing July first, nineteen hundred  ninety-five,  shall
      be credited to and deposited in the criminal justice account established
      within  the  general fund of the city for the implementation of the safe
      streets-safe city program. The balance of such revenue shall be credited
      to the general fund of the city and shall be applied exclusively  to  or
      in  aid  or support of the city's provision of criminal justice and fire
      protection services.
        (f) Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary,  of  the
      total  revenue (including interest and penalties) from the tax surcharge
      imposed pursuant to the  authority  of  this  section  which  the  state
      comptroller  is  required to pay to the chief fiscal officer of the city
      for payment into the  treasury  of  the  city,  ninety  million  dollars
      thereof  paid to such chief fiscal officer during the fiscal year of the
      city commencing during calendar year nineteen  hundred  ninety-six,  and
      one  hundred  eighty-five  million  dollars  thereof  paid to such chief
      fiscal officer during the fiscal year  of  the  city  commencing  during
      calendar  year  nineteen  hundred ninety-seven, shall be credited to and
      deposited in a criminal justice account established by the  city  within
      its  general  fund.  The balance of such revenue from such tax surcharge
      which the state comptroller is required to  pay  to  such  chief  fiscal
      officer  for payment into the treasury of the city for the taxable years
      beginning in the calendar years beginning  on  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-seven  and  January first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight
      shall be credited to  the  general  fund  of  the  city  to  be  applied
      exclusively  to or in aid or support of the city's provision of criminal
      justice  and  fire  protection   services;   provided   however,   that,
      notwithstanding   the  foregoing,  such  balance  shall  be  applied  to
      implementation of the capital program for public schools within the city
      and a supplemental capital rehabilitation program for such  schools,  to
    
      the   extent   that   such  application  is  necessary  for  the  timely
      implementation of such programs in accordance  with  the  memorandum  of
      understanding  executed  pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (d) of
      this section and any modifications thereto.

      and methods. (1) Accounting periods. A  taxpayer's  taxable  year  under
      this  chapter  shall  be the same as his taxable year for federal income
      tax purposes.
        (2) Change of accounting periods. If  a  taxpayer's  taxable  year  is
      changed  for  federal income tax purposes, his taxable year for purposes
      of this chapter shall be similarly changed. If a taxable  year  of  less
      than  twelve  months  results  from  a  change of taxable year, the city
      standard deduction and the  city  exemptions  shall  be  prorated  under
      regulations of the tax commission.
        (3)  Accounting  methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this
      chapter shall be the same as his method of accounting for federal income
      tax purposes. In the absence of any method  of  accounting  for  federal
      income  tax  purposes,  city taxable income shall be computed under such
      method as in the opinion of the tax commission clearly reflects income.
        (4) Change of accounting  methods.  (A)  If  a  taxpayer's  method  of
      accounting  is  changed  for  federal income tax purposes, his method of
      accounting for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed.
        (B) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other  than  from
      an  accrual  to  an installment method, any additional tax which results
      from adjustments determined to be necessary  solely  by  reason  of  the
      change  shall  not  be  greater  than  if  such adjustments were ratably
      allocated and included for the  taxable  year  of  the  change  and  the
      preceding taxable years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer
      used the method of accounting from which the change is made.
        (C) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to
      an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of
      method  and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt
      of installment payments properly accrued  in  a  prior  year,  shall  be
      reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to
      the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations
      of the tax commission.

      than  ninety  days,  and  (III)  during  any  period of less than twelve
      months, which would be treated as a separate taxable period pursuant  to
      section 11-1754, and which period is contained within the period of five
      hundred  forty-eight  consecutive  days, the taxpayer is present in this
      city for a number of days which does not exceed an  amount  which  bears
      the  same ratio to ninety as the number of days contained in that period
      of less than twelve months bears to five hundred forty-eight, or
        (B) who is not domiciled in this city but maintains a permanent  place
      of  abode in this city and spends in the aggregate more than one hundred
      eighty-three days  of  the  taxable  year  in  this  city,  unless  such

      irrevocable; or
        (ii)  a  person  domiciled  in  this  city  at the time such trust, or
      portion of a trust, became irrevocable, if it was  revocable  when  such

      were a non-resident trust.
        (ii)  For  purposes  of  item (II) of clause (i) of this subparagraph,
      intangible property shall be located in this city if one or more of  the
      trustees are domiciled in the city of New York.
        (iii)  Provided  further,  that for the purposes of item (I) of clause
      (i) of this subparagraph, a trustee which is a  banking  corporation  as
      defined  in subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this title and which is
      domiciled outside the city of New York at the time it becomes a  trustee
      of  the  trust  shall  be  deemed  to continue to be a trustee domiciled
      outside  the  city  of  New  York  notwithstanding  that  it  thereafter
      otherwise  becomes a trustee domiciled in the city of New York by virtue
      of being acquired by, or becoming an office or branch  of,  a  corporate
      trustee domiciled within the city of New York.
        For  the  purposes  of the foregoing, a trust or portion of a trust is
      revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any
      future time, to revest title in the person  whose  property  constitutes
      such  trust  or  portion  of  a trust, and a trust or portion of a trust
      becomes  irrevocable  when  the  possibility  that  such  power  may  be
      exercised has been terminated.
        (4)  City  nonresident  estate  or trust. A city nonresident estate or
      trust means an estate or trust which is not a city  resident  estate  or
      trust.
        (5)  Cross  reference.  For effect of a change of resident status, see
      section 11-1754.

      gain.  For taxable years beginning in nineteen hundred  eighty-seven,  a
      credit  against  the tax imposed under section 11-1701 shall be allowed.
      The amount of the credit shall be one-half of one percent of net capital
      gain includible in city adjusted gross income for the taxable year.  The
      credit  allowed  by this subdivision shall not exceed the tax imposed by
      section 11-1701 reduced by the credits permitted under  section  11-1721
      and subdivision (b) of this section.
        (b)  Household  credit. (1) For taxable years beginning after nineteen
      hundred eighty-six, a  credit  against  the  city  personal  income  tax
      imposed  by  section  11-1701  shall be allowed. The credit, computed as
      described in paragraph two of this subdivision, shall not exceed the tax
      imposed by section  11-1701,  reduced  by  the  credit  permitted  under
      section 11-1721.
        (2)  (A)  For  any  individual  who  is  not married nor the head of a
      household nor a surviving spouse, the amount  of  the  credit  shall  be

        (B)  For  any husband and wife, head of household or surviving spouse,
      the amount of the credit shall be determined by multiplying  the  number
      of  exemptions  for  which the taxpayer (or in the case of a husband and
      wife, taxpayers) is entitled to a deduction for  the  taxable  year  for
      federal income tax purposes under subsections (b) and (c) of section one

        (3) For purposes of this subsection:
        (A) "Household gross income" shall mean the aggregate federal adjusted
      gross  income  of  a  household,  as  the  term  household is defined in
      subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, for the taxable year.
        (B) "Household" means a husband and  wife,  a  head  of  household,  a
      surviving  spouse, or an individual who is not married nor the head of a
      household nor a surviving spouse nor a taxpayer with respect to  whom  a
      deduction  under  subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the
      internal revenue code is allowable to another taxpayer for  the  taxable
      year.
        (C)  "Household  gross  income  of  a  husband  and wife" shall be the
      aggregate of their federal adjusted gross incomes for the  taxable  year
      irrespective  of  whether  joint or separate city income tax returns are
      filed. Provided, however, that a husband or wife who is required to file
      a separate city income tax return shall be permitted one-half the credit
      otherwise allowed his or her household, except as limited  by  paragraph
      one of this subdivision.
        (D) "Household gross income" shall be computed in all cases as if each
      member of the household were a resident for the entire taxable year.
        (E)  If  a  taxpayer  changes  his status during his taxable year from
      resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the  household
      credit shall be prorated according to the number of months in the period
      of  residence.  In  the  case  of  a husband and wife, if either or both
      changes  his  or  her  status  from  resident  to  nonresident  or  from
      nonresident  to  resident  and  separate  returns  are filed, the credit
      computed for the entire year shall  be  divided  first  as  provided  in
      subparagraph  (C)  of  this paragraph and then prorated according to the
      number of months in the period of residence.
        * (c) State school tax reduction credit.
        (1) For taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-seven, a
      state school tax reduction credit shall be allowed as  provided  in  the
      following  tables.  The  credit  shall  be  allowed  against  the  taxes
      authorized by this article reduced by  the  credits  permitted  by  this
      article.  If  the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may
      receive,  and  the  comptroller,  subject  to  a  certificate   of   the
      commissioner,  shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the amount
      of such excess. For purposes of this subdivision,  no  credit  shall  be
      granted  to  an  individual  with  respect  to  whom  a  deduction under
      subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the internal  revenue
      code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.
        (2)  The amount of the credit under this paragraph shall be determined
      based upon the taxpayer's income as  defined  in  subparagraph  (ii)  of
      paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-five of
      the  real property tax law. For purposes of this paragraph, any taxpayer
      under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph with  income  of  more
      than two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall not receive a credit.
        Beginning  in  the  two  thousand  ten  tax  year  and  each  tax year
      thereafter, the "more than two hundred  fifty  thousand  dollar"  income
      limitation  shall be adjusted by applying the inflation factor set forth
      herein, and rounding each result to the nearest multiple of one  hundred
      dollars.  The  department  shall  establish  the income limitation to be
      associated with each subsequent  tax  year  by  applying  the  inflation
      factor set forth herein to the figures that define the income limitation
    
      that  were  applicable to the preceding tax year, as determined pursuant
      to this subdivision, and rounding each result to the nearest multiple of
      one hundred dollars. Such determination shall  be  made  no  later  than
      March first, two thousand ten and each year thereafter.
        For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  the  "inflation  factor" shall be
      determined in accordance with the provisions set  forth  in  subdivision
      fifteen of section one hundred seventy-eight of the tax law.
        (A) Married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. In
      the case of a husband and wife who make a single return jointly and of a
      surviving spouse:
           For taxable years beginning:       The credit shall be:
                     in 2001-2005                    $125
                     in 2006                         $230
                     in 2007-2008                    $290
                     in 2009 and after               $125
        (B)  All  others.  In the case of an unmarried individual, a head of a
      household or a married individual filing a separate return:
           For taxable years beginning:       The credit shall be:
                     in 2001-2005                    $62.50
                     in 2006                         $115
                     in 2007-2008                    $145
                     in 2009 and after               $62.50
        (4) Husband and wife who make a joint return. If a  husband  and  wife
      make a single return jointly, the credit under this subdivision shall be
      determined  under  paragraph  two of this subdivision, if either of them
      has attained the age of sixty-five on or before the close of the taxable
      year.
        (5) Part-year residents. If  a  taxpayer  changes  status  during  the
      taxable  year  from  resident  to  nonresident,  or  from nonresident to
      resident, the state  school  tax  reduction  credit  shall  be  prorated
      according to the number of months in the period of residence.
        * NB There are 2 sub (c)'s
        * (c)  Credit  for  unincorporated  business  taxes  paid.  (1) A city
      resident individual, estate or trust whose city  adjusted  gross  income
      includes   income,   gain,   loss   or   deductions  from  one  or  more
      unincorporated businesses conducted by such  city  resident  individual,
      estate  or  trust that are subject to the tax imposed by chapter five of
      this title, or a distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions
      of, or guaranteed payments from,  one  or  more  partnerships  that  are
      subject to the tax imposed by such chapter, shall be allowed a credit as
      provided  in paragraph two of this subdivision against the tax otherwise
      due under sections 11-1701,  11-1703,  11-1704  and  11-1704.1  of  this
      chapter.
        (2)  (A)  Subject  to  the limitation set forth in subparagraph (B) of
      this paragraph, the credit allowed to a  taxpayer  for  a  taxable  year
      under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:
        (i)  For  taxable  years beginning on or after January first, nineteen
      hundred ninety-seven and before January first, two thousand seven:
        (I) If the city taxable income is forty-two thousand dollars or  less,
      the  credit  shall  be  sixty-five  percent  of the amount determined in
      paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (II) If the city taxable income is  greater  than  forty-two  thousand
      dollars but not greater than one hundred forty-two thousand dollars, the
      amount  of  the credit shall be a percentage of the amount determined in
      paragraph three of this subdivision, such percentage to be determined by
      subtracting from sixty-five percent, one-tenth  of  a  percentage  point
      (.001)  for  every  increment of two hundred dollars, or fractional part
      thereof, of city taxable income in excess of forty-two thousand dollars.
    
        (III) If the city taxable income is greater than one hundred forty-two
      thousand dollars, the credit shall be  fifteen  percent  of  the  amount
      determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (ii)  For  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after January first, two
      thousand seven:
        (I) If the city taxable income is forty-two thousand dollars or  less,
      the  credit  shall  be  one  hundred percent of the amount determined in
      paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (II) If the city taxable income is  greater  than  forty-two  thousand
      dollars but less than one hundred forty-two thousand dollars, the amount
      of  the  credit  shall  be  a  percentage  of  the  amount determined in
      paragraph three of this subdivision, such percentage to be determined by
      subtracting  from  one  hundred  percent,  a  percentage  determined  by
      subtracting   forty-two  thousand  dollars  from  city  taxable  income,
      dividing the result by one hundred thousand dollars and  multiplying  by
      seventy-seven percent.
        (III)  If  the  city  taxable income is one hundred forty-two thousand
      dollars or greater, the credit shall  be  twenty-three  percent  of  the
      amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (B)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of
      this paragraph, the credit allowed to a  taxpayer  for  a  taxable  year
      under  this subdivision shall not exceed the sum of the taxes that would
      otherwise be imposed by sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1
      of this chapter on  such  taxpayer  for  such  taxable  year  after  the
      allowance  of  any  other  credits  allowed  by  this section or section
      11-1721 of this chapter.
        (3) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of  this  paragraph,
      the amount determined in this paragraph is the sum of:
        (A)  for  each  unincorporated business conducted by the taxpayer, the
      tax imposed by  chapter  five  of  this  title  on  such  unincorporated
      business  for  its  taxable  year  ending  with  the taxable year of the
      taxpayer and paid by the unincorporated business; and
        (B) for each unincorporated  business  in  which  the  taxpayer  is  a
      partner, the product of:
        (i)  the  sum  of (I) the tax imposed by chapter five of this title on
      such unincorporated business for its taxable year ending within or  with
      the  taxable year of the partner and paid by the unincorporated business
      and (II) the amount of any credit or credits taken by the unincorporated
      business under subdivision (j) of section 11-503 of this title  for  its
      taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner; and
        (ii)  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is the net total of the
      partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss  and  deductions  of,
      and  guaranteed  payments  from,  the  unincorporated  business for such
      taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such  taxable
      year,  of  the  net  total distributive shares of income, gain, loss and
      deductions  of,  and  guaranteed  payments  to,  all  partners  in   the
      unincorporated  business for whom or which such net total (as separately
      determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
        (C) For a taxpayer that changes its status from a city resident  to  a
      city  nonresident  or  from a city nonresident to a city resident during
      the taxable year:
        (i) the amount determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall
      be,  with  respect  to  each  unincorporated  business  conducted by the
      taxpayer, the tax  imposed  by  chapter  five  of  this  title  on  such
      unincorporated  business  for  its  taxable year ending with the taxable
      year of the taxpayer and paid by the unincorporated business, multiplied
      by a fraction, the numerator of which is that  portion  of  the  income,
      gain, loss and deductions of the unincorporated business included in the
    
      taxpayer's  adjusted  gross  income  for the portion of the taxable year
      during which the taxpayer was a city resident, and  the  denominator  of
      which is the total, for such taxable year, of the income, gain, loss and
      deductions of the unincorporated business, and
        (ii)  the amount determined in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this
      paragraph shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of
      the taxpayer's net total distributive share of income,  gain,  loss  and
      deductions  of,  and  that  portion  of  guaranteed  payments  from, the
      unincorporated business included in the taxpayer's city  adjusted  gross
      income for the portion of the taxable year during which the taxpayer was
      a  city  resident,  and  the  denominator  of which is the sum, for such
      taxable year, of the net total distributive shares of income, gain, loss
      and deductions of, and guaranteed  payments  to,  all  partners  in  the
      unincorporated business, for whom or which such net total (as separately
      determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
        (4)  For purposes of subdivision (c) of section 11-1902 of this title,
      in determining the amount of tax that a nonresident would be required to
      pay if such nonresident were a resident of the city and subject  to  the
      tax  on  personal  income  of  residents,  the  credit  allowed  by this
      subdivision shall be taken into account.
        * NB There are 2 sub (c)'s
        (d) Earned income tax credit. (1) For taxable  years  beginning  after
      two  thousand three, a credit against the city personal income tax shall
      be allowed, equal to five percent of the earned  income  credit  allowed
      under  section  thirty-two  of  the  internal  revenue code for the same
      taxable year.
        (2) In the case of a resident taxpayer, the credit  provided  by  this
      subdivision  shall  be  allowed  against  the  taxes  authorized by this
      chapter for the taxable year reduced by the credits  permitted  by  this
      chapter.  If  the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may
      receive, and the state comptroller, subject  to  a  certificate  of  the
      commissioner  of the state department of taxation and finance, shall pay
      as an overpayment, without interest, the amount of such excess.
        (3) If a taxpayer changes his or her status during  the  taxable  year
      from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city
      resident,  the credit determined under this subdivision shall be limited
      to the amount determined by multiplying the amount of such credit  by  a
      fraction,  the numerator of which is such taxpayer's city adjusted gross
      income, for the period of residence, and the  denominator  of  which  is
      such  taxpayer's  city  adjusted gross income determined as if he or she
      were a city resident for the entire taxable year.  City  adjusted  gross
      income shall be adjusted as provided in section 11-1754 of this chapter.
      The  credit  as so limited shall be applied as provided in paragraph two
      of this subdivision.
        (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph three of this  subdivision,
      in  the  case of a husband and wife who file a joint return, but who are
      required to determine their city personal income taxes  separately,  the
      credit  authorized  pursuant  to this subdivision may be applied against
      the tax of either or divided between them as they may elect. In the case
      of a husband and wife who are not required to file a federal return, the
      credit under this subsection shall be allowed  only  if  such  taxpayers
      file a joint city personal income tax return.
        (e) Credit for certain household and dependent care services necessary
      for  gainful  employment.  (1)  For  taxable years beginning on or after
      January first, two thousand seven, a taxpayer shall be allowed a  credit
      as  provided  herein  equal  to  the applicable percentage of the credit
      allowed under subsection (c) of section six hundred six of the  tax  law
      with  respect  to  qualifying individuals as defined in paragraph one of
    
      subsection (b) of  section  twenty-one  of  the  internal  revenue  code
      (without regard to whether the taxpayer in fact claimed the credit under
      such  section twenty-one for the taxable year) who are dependents of the
      taxpayer  and who have not attained the age of four as of the end of the
      taxable year. The applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:
        (A) If household gross  income  as  defined  in  subparagraph  (A)  of
      paragraph  three  of  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section is twenty-five
      thousand  dollars  or  less,  the   applicable   percentage   shall   be
      seventy-five percent.
        (B)  If  such  household  gross  income  is  greater  than twenty-five
      thousand dollars but not  greater  than  thirty  thousand  dollars,  the
      applicable  percentage  shall  be seventy-five percent multiplied by one
      minus a fraction, the numerator of which is such household gross  income
      less  twenty-five  thousand dollars and the denominator of which is five
      thousand dollars.
        (C) If such household gross income is  greater  than  thirty  thousand
      dollars, the applicable percentage shall be zero.
        (2)  The  credit  under  this subdivision shall be allowed against the
      taxes imposed by this chapter reduced by the credits permitted  by  this
      chapter.  If  the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may
      receive, and the state comptroller, subject to the  certificate  of  the
      state commissioner of taxation and finance, shall pay as an overpayment,
      without  interest,  the amount of such excess, provided, however, in the
      case of a taxpayer who is a part-year resident of New York city any such
      overpayment under this paragraph shall be limited to the amount of  such
      excess  multiplied  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator of which is federal
      adjusted gross income for the period of residence, computed  as  if  the
      taxable  year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the period
      of residence, and the denominator of which  is  federal  adjusted  gross
      income for the taxable year.
        (3)  In  the  case  of  a  husband  and wife who filed a joint federal
      return, but who are required to determine  their  New  York  city  taxes
      separately,  the credit allowed pursuant to this subdivision may only be
      applied against the tax imposed on the spouse  with  the  lower  taxable
      income,  computed  without  regard to such credit, provided, however, if
      the spouse with the lower taxable income is a nonresident of  the  city,
      no  credit  shall  be  allowed  under this subdivision. In the case of a
      husband and wife who are not required to  file  a  federal  return,  the
      credit  under  this  subdivision shall be allowed only if such taxpayers
      file a joint New York city income tax return.
        (f) Credit for general corporation  tax  paid.  (1)  A  city  resident
      individual,  estate or trust whose city adjusted gross income includes a
      pro rata share of income, loss and deductions described in paragraph one
      of subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the  internal
      revenue  code,  from  one  or more New York S corporations as defined in
      subdivision one-A of section two hundred eight of the tax law,  or  from
      one or more QSSSs as defined in subdivision one-B of section two hundred
      eight  of  the tax law, that are exempt QSSSs by reason of clause (A) of
      subparagraph one of paragraph (k) of subdivision  nine  of  section  two
      hundred  eight  of  the tax law, on which a tax is imposed by subchapter
      two of chapter six of this title, shall be allowed a credit as  provided
      in paragraph two of this subdivision against the tax otherwise due under
      sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1 of this chapter.
        (2)(A)  Subject  to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (B) and
      (C) of this paragraph, the credit allowed to a taxpayer  for  a  taxable
      year under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:
        (i)  For  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January first, two
      thousand fourteen and before July first, two thousand fifteen:
    
        (I) If the city taxable income  is  thirty-five  thousand  dollars  or
      less,  the  amount  of  the  credit  shall be one hundred percent of the
      amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.
        (II)  If  the city taxable income is greater than thirty-five thousand
      dollars but less than one hundred thousand dollars, the  amount  of  the
      credit shall be a percentage of the amount determined in paragraph three
      of  this  subdivision,  such  percentage to be determined by subtracting
      from  one  hundred  percent,  a  percentage  determined  by  subtracting
      thirty-five  thousand  dollars  from  city  taxable income, dividing the
      result by sixty-five thousand dollars and  multiplying  by  one  hundred
      percent.
        (III)  If  the  city taxable income is one hundred thousand dollars or
      greater, no credit shall be allowed.
        (IV) Provided further that for any taxable  year  of  a  taxpayer  for
      which  this  credit  is  effective that encompasses days occurring after
      June  thirtieth,  two  thousand  fifteen,  the  amount  of  the   credit
      determined  in  item (I) or (II) of this clause shall be multiplied by a
      fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxpayer's
      taxable year  occurring  on  or  before  June  thirtieth,  two  thousand
      fifteen,  and  the  denominator  of  which  is the number of days in the
      taxpayer's taxable year.
        (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  subparagraph  (A)  of
      this  paragraph,  the  credit  allowed  to a taxpayer for a taxable year
      under this subdivision shall not exceed the sum of the taxes that  would
      otherwise be imposed by sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1
      of  this  chapter  on  such  taxpayer  for  such  taxable year after the
      allowance of any other credits allowed by subdivisions (a)  and  (b)  of
      this  section,  and subdivision (c) of this section, as added by chapter
      four hundred eighty-one of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-seven and
      subsequently amended, and section 11-1721 of this chapter.
        (C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  subparagraph  (A)  of
      this  paragraph,  no  credit  shall  be  allowed  for  any amount of tax
      imposed, or credit allowed, by subchapter two of  chapter  six  of  this
      title on, or to, a combined group of corporations including a New York S
      corporation  or an exempt QSSS, except where the combined group consists
      exclusively of one or more New York  S  corporations  and  one  or  more
      exempt  QSSSs of such corporations as described in paragraph one of this
      subdivision, provided that each of the New York S corporations  included
      in  the  group  is  wholly  owned  by the same interests and in the same
      proportions as each other New York S corporation included in the group.
        (3) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B)  of  this  paragraph
      and  subparagraph  (C)  of paragraph two of this subdivision, the amount
      determined in this paragraph is the sum of the taxpayer's pro rata share
      of the amounts determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for each
      New York S corporation, or exempt QSSS, described in  paragraph  one  of
      this  subsection,  a pro rata share of whose income, loss and deductions
      described in paragraph one of subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred
      sixty-six of the internal revenue code, is included  in  the  taxpayer's
      city adjusted gross income.
        (A) The amount determined in this subparagraph is the sum of:
        (i)  the  taxes imposed by subchapter two of chapter six of this title
      on such corporation, or a combined group including such corporation, for
      its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the  taxpayer
      and paid by such corporation, or combined group; and
        (ii) the amount of any credit or credits taken by such corporation, or
      a  combined group including such corporation, under subdivision eighteen
      of section 11-604 of this title for its taxable year  ending  within  or
      with the taxable year of the taxpayer.
    
        (B) For purposes of this subdivision, the taxpayer's pro rata share of
      the  amount  in  subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for the taxable year
      shall be the amount determined with respect to the taxpayer:
        (i) by assigning an equal portion of the amount in subparagraph (A) of
      this  paragraph  to  each day of the corporation's taxable year on which
      the corporation has shares outstanding,
        (ii)  then  by  dividing  that  portion  pro  rata  among  the  shares
      outstanding on that day; provided, however,
        (iii)  if the taxable year of such corporation for purposes of chapter
      six of this title is different from its New York S year or S short  year
      as  defined in subdivision one-A of section two hundred eight of the tax
      law, or subsection (f) of section fourteen hundred fifty of the tax law,
      only those portions that are assigned to days of the taxable  year  that
      are also days of the New York S year or S short year shall be taken into
      account  in  determining  the shareholder's pro rata share of the amount
      determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
