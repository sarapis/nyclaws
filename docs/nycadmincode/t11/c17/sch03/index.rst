Section 11-1751 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1751  Returns  and  liabilities.  (a)  General. On or before the
      fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of a taxable year,
      an income tax return under this chapter shall be made and  filed  by  or
      for  every  city resident individual, estate or trust required to file a
      New York state personal income tax (including a minimum income  tax  and
      separate  tax  on the ordinary income portion of lump sum distributions)
      return for the taxable year.
        (b) Husband and wife. (1) If the New York state  personal  income  tax
      liability  of husband and wife is determined on a separate return, their
      city personal income tax liabilities and returns shall be separate.
        (2) If the New York state personal income tax liabilities  of  husband
      and  wife  (other  than a husband and wife described in paragraph three)
      are determined on a joint return, they shall file a joint city  personal
      income  tax return, and their tax liabilities shall be joint and several
      except as provided  in  paragraph  five  of  this  subdivision,  section
      11-1755  of  this  chapter  and  subsection  (e)  of section six hundred
      eighty-five of the tax law.
        (3) If either husband or wife is a city resident and the  other  is  a
      city   nonresident,  and  their  New  York  state  personal  income  tax
      liabilities are determined on a joint return:
        (A) they may elect to file a joint city personal income tax return  as
      if  both  were  residents,  in which case their city personal income tax
      liabilities shall be joint and several except as provided  in  paragraph
      five of this subdivision, section 11-1755 of this chapter and subsection
      (e) of section six hundred eighty-five of the tax law, or
        (B)  the  resident  spouse  may elect to file a separate city personal
      income tax return, in which case his city personal income tax  liability
      shall  be  determined  as  if  he  were filing a separate New York state
      personal income tax return.
        (5) If a joint return has been  made  under  this  subdivision  for  a
      taxable  year  and  only one spouse is liable for past-due support, or a
      past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of  New  York  tax  warrant
      judgment  debt,  or  an amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed
      student, state university or city university loan  of  which  the  state
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  has  been notified pursuant to
      section  one  hundred  seventy-one-c,  one  hundred  seventy-one-d,  one
      hundred   seventy-one-e,   one  hundred  seventy-one-f  or  one  hundred
      seventy-one-l of the tax law, as the case may be,  then  an  overpayment
      and interest thereon shall be credited against such past-due support, or
      a  past-due  legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant
      judgment debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a  guaranteed
      student, state university or city university loan, unless the spouse not
      liable  for  such  past-due  support,  or a past-due legally enforceable
      debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of
      a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city
      university loan demands,  on  a  declaration  made  in  accordance  with
      regulations  or  instructions  prescribed  by  the state commissioner of
      taxation and finance, that the portion of the overpayment  and  interest
      attributable  to  such  spouse  not  be  credited  against  the past-due
      support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of  New  York
      tax  warrant  judgment  debt,  or  amount of a default in repayment of a
      guaranteed student, state university or city university loan owed by the
      other spouse. Upon such demand, the state commissioner of  taxation  and
      finance  shall  determine  the amount of the overpayment attributable to
      each spouse in accordance  with  regulations  prescribed  by  the  state
      commissioner of taxation and finance and credit only that portion of the
      overpayment  and  interest thereon attributable to the spouse liable for
      past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a  city  of
    
      New  York tax warrant judgment debt, or amount of a default in repayment
      of a guaranteed  student,  state  university  or  city  university  loan
      against  such  past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt,
      or  a  city  of  New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of a
      default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university  or  city
      university  loan.  Such  demand  may be filed (A) with the return of the
      spouse not liable for past-due support or past-due  legally  enforceable
      debt,  or  a  city  of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or default in
      repayment of a guaranteed student, state university, or city  university
      loan  or  (B)  with  the commissioner of taxation and finance within ten
      days after notification is provided such spouse by the  commissioner  of
      taxation  and  finance  pursuant  to  subdivision  seven  of section one
      hundred  seventy-one-c,  subdivision  six   of   section   one   hundred
      seventy-one-d,  subdivision  seven of section one hundred seventy-one-e,
      subdivision seven of section one hundred  seventy-one-f  or  subdivision
      six of section one hundred seventy-one-l of the New York state tax law.
        (6) The state commissioner of taxation and finance shall clearly alert
      married  taxpayers,  on  all  appropriate publications and instructions,
      that their liability for tax will be joint  and  several  if  they  file
      joint income tax returns. The state commissioner of taxation and finance
      shall  include  notice of an individual's right to relief from joint and
      several liability pursuant to section six hundred fifty-four of the  tax
      law  in  the  disclosure  of  rights statement required by section three
      thousand four of the tax law and in any notice regarding  collection  of
      tax due with respect to a liability on a joint return.
        (c)  Decedents.  The  return for any deceased individual shall be made
      and filed by his or her executor, administrator, or other person charged
      with his or her property. If a final return  of  a  decedent  is  for  a
      fractional  part  of  a  year,  the due date of such return shall be the
      fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month  following  the  close   of   the
      twelve-month  period  which  began with the first day of such fractional
      part of the year.
        (d) Individuals under a disability. The return for an  individual  who
      is  unable  to  make  a return by reason of minority or other disability
      shall be made and filed by his or her guardian, committee, fiduciary  or
      other  person  charged  with  the  care of his or her person or property
      (other than a receiver in possession of  only  a  part  of  his  or  her
      property), or by his or her duly authorized agent.
        (e)  Estates  and  trusts.  The return for an estate or trust shall be
      made and filed by the fiduciary.
        (f) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting  jointly,
      the return may be made by any one of them.
        (h) Tax a debt. Any tax under this chapter, and any increase, interest
      or  penalty  thereon,  shall,  from the time it is due and payable, be a
      personal debt of the person liable to pay the same, to the city  of  New
      York.
        (i)  Cross  reference.  For  provisions  as  to information returns by
      partnerships, employers and other persons, see section 11-1758.

Section 11-1752 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1752 Time and place for filing returns and paying tax. (a) Except
      as  provided  in  subdivision  (b) of this section, a person required to
      make and file a return under this  chapter  shall,  without  assessment,
      notice  or  demand,  pay  any  tax  due  thereon  to the commissioner of
      taxation and finance on or before the date fixed for filing such  return
      (determined  without  regard  to  any  extension  of time for filing the
      return). The commissioner shall prescribe by regulation  the  place  for
      filing  any  return,  statement,  or other document required pursuant to
      this chapter and for payment of any tax.
        (b) The commissioner of taxation and finance may allow individuals who
      have income only from wages, salaries, tips and  like  remuneration  for
      services  performed as an employee, interest, dividends and unemployment
      compensation to elect to have the commissioner compute the tax  due.  To
      provide   for   expeditious   and  uniform  administration  of  the  tax
      computations which involve  numerous  variables,  the  commissioner  may
      further  qualify,  with  regard  to  period  of  residency,  deductions,
      credits, exemptions, amount and character of gross income, and any other
      appropriate factors relative to calculation of  tax,  those  individuals
      who may elect to have their taxes computed by the commissioner. Any such
      election  shall  be  made on the form prescribed by the commissioner for
      this purpose. If a qualified taxpayer elects to  have  the  commissioner
      compute the tax, the amount determined by the commissioner shall be paid
      (i) within ten days from the date of the issuance of a notice and demand
      therefor  or  (ii)  on the date fixed for filing such return (determined
      without regard to any extension of time for filing), whichever is later.

Section 11-1753 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1753  Signing  of  returns and other documents. (a) General. Any
      return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this
      chapter shall be signed in accordance with regulations  or  instructions
      prescribed  by the tax commission. The fact that an individual's name is
      signed to a return, statement, or other document, shall be  prima  facie
      evidence  for  all purposes that the return, statement or other document
      was actually signed by such individual.
        (b) Partnerships. Any return, statement or other document required  of
      a  partnership  shall be signed by one or more partners. The fact that a
      partner's name is signed to a  return,  statement,  or  other  document,
      shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  for all purposes that such partner is
      authorized to sign on behalf of the partnership.
        (c) Certifications. The making or filing of any return,  statement  or
      other  document or copy thereof required to be made or filed pursuant to
      this chapter, including a copy of a federal return, shall  constitute  a
      certification  by  the person making or filing such return, statement or
      other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are
      true and that any copy filed is a true copy.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1754
---------------

Section 11-1754 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1754  Change  of  resident status. (a) General. If an individual
      changes his or her status during his  or  her  taxable  year  from  city
      resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident,
      such  individual  shall file one return as a resident for the portion of
      the year during which he or she is a city resident, and a  return  under
      chapter nineteen of this title, for the portion of the year during which
      he  or  she is a city nonresident, subject to such exceptions as the tax
      commission may prescribe by regulation.
        (b) City taxable income  and  city  minimum  taxable  income  as  city
      resident.  The  city  taxable income and city minimum taxable income for
      the portion of the year during which he or she is a city resident  shall
      be  determined,  except as provided in subdivision (c), as if his or her
      taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the  period
      of his or her city resident status.
        (c) Special accruals.
        (1)  If  an individual changes his or her status from city resident to
      city nonresident, he or she shall, regardless of his or  her  method  of
      accounting, accrue to the period of residence any items of income, gain,
      loss  or  deduction  accruing  prior  to  the  change  of status, if not
      otherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election  to
      report  on  an  installment  basis)  or  allowable  for  city income tax
      purposes for the portion of the taxable year  prior  to  the  change  of
      status  or  for  a prior taxable year. The amounts of such accrued items
      shall be determined  with  the  applicable  modifications  described  in
      sections 11-1712 and 11-1715 as if such accrued items were includible or
      allowable for federal income tax purposes.
        (2)  If  an individual changes his or her status from city nonresident
      to city resident, he or she shall, regardless of his or  her  method  of
      accounting,  accrue  to  the period of nonresidence any items of income,
      gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change  of  status,  other
      than items derived from or connected with New York state sources, if not
      otherwise  properly includible (whether or not because of an election to
      report on an installment basis) or  allowable  for  federal  income  tax
      purposes  for  the  portion  of  the taxable year prior to the change of
      status or for a prior taxable year. The amounts of  such  accrued  items
      shall  be  determined  with  the  applicable  modifications described in
      sections 11-1712 and 11-1715 as if such accrued items were includible or
      allowable for federal income tax purposes.
        (3) No item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is accrued  under
      this  subdivision  shall  be  taken  into  account  in  determining city
      adjusted gross income or the city itemized deduction for any  subsequent
      taxable period.
        (4)  The  accruals under this subdivision shall not be required if the
      individual files with the  tax  commission  a  bond  or  other  security
      acceptable  to  the  tax  commission,  conditioned upon the inclusion of
      amounts accruable under this subdivision in city adjusted  gross  income
      for  one  or  more subsequent taxable years as if the individual had not
      changed his or her resident status.
        (5) The foregoing  provisions  of  this  section  shall  apply  if  an
      individual  changes  his status from a city resident to city nonresident
      or from a city nonresident to a city resident during a taxable year,  or
      at  the beginning of a taxable year, as a result of a change of domicile
      or as a result of becoming a city resident or city nonresident based  on
      the  definition  contained  in  subparagraph  (B)  of  paragraph  one of
      subdivision (b) of section 11-1705 of this chapter.
        (6) Except as hereinafter provided,  where  an  individual  who  is  a
      member  of  a  partnership  or  shareholder  of an S corporation changes
      status from city resident to city nonresident, or from city  nonresident
    
      to  city  resident, the portion of the distributive or pro rata share of
      income, gain and loss (less  deductions  attributable  thereto)  from  a
      partnership  or  S  corporation  shall  be allocated to the resident and
      nonresident  periods  of  the  partner or shareholder on a proportionate
      basis throughout the taxable year of the partnership or  S  corporation.
      In  such  event,  the  portion  of  the  distributive  or pro rata share
      allocated to the period of residency shall be determined  based  on  the
      number  of  days  of  residency  within  the  reporting  period  of  the
      partnership or S corporation over  the  total  number  of  days  in  the
      reporting period of the partnership or S corporation. Provided, however,
      that  the  commissioner  may  require,  or  the individual may elect, to
      accrue to the period of residence, and the period of  nonresidence,  the
      portion  of  the  distributive  or  pro  rata  share of partnership or S
      corporation income, gain and loss (less deductions attributable thereto)
      accruing during the individual's  respective  resident  and  nonresident
      periods  in  a  manner that reflects the date of accrual of said income,
      gain and loss by the partnership or S corporation.
        (7) Except as hereinafter provided,  where  an  individual  who  is  a
      beneficiary  of  an estate or trust changes status from city resident to
      city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the portion
      of any estate  or  trust  income  credited,  distributable,  payable  or
      required to be distributed to such beneficiary shall be allocated to the
      resident  and  nonresident periods of the beneficiary on a proportionate
      basis throughout the taxable year of the estate or trust. In such event,
      the portion of such estate or trust income allocated to  the  period  of
      residency  shall  be determined based on the number of days of residency
      within the reporting period of the estate or trust over the total number
      of days in the reporting  period  of  the  estate  or  trust.  Provided,
      however,  that  the  commissioner  may  require,  or the beneficiary may
      elect, to  accrue  to  the  period  of  residence,  and  the  period  of
      nonresidence, the portion of such estate or trust income accruing during
      the  beneficiary's  respective  resident  and  nonresident  periods in a
      manner that reflects the date of accrual of said estate or trust  income
      by the estate or trust.
        (d)  City  minimum  tax.  Where  two  returns  are required under this
      section, the total of the taxes due thereon shall not be less than would
      be due if the city taxable incomes reportable on the  two  returns  were
      included in one return.
        (e) Proration. Where a return is required under this section, the city
      personal  exemptions  allowable under section 11-1716 shall be prorated,
      under regulations of the tax commission, to reflect the portions of  the
      entire taxable year during which the individual was a resident.
        (f) Standard deduction. Where a return is required under this section,
      the city standard deduction allowable on such return shall be the amount
      allowed   pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  11-1714,  prorated
      according to the period covered by the return.
        (g) Trusts. If the status of a trust changes during its  taxable  year
      from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city
      resident,  the  fiduciary shall file one return as a city resident trust
      for the portion of the year during which the trust is  a  city  resident
      trust,  and  one  return  under  chapter  nineteen of this title for the
      portion of the year during which the trust is a city nonresident  trust,
      subject  to  such  exceptions  as  the  tax  commission may prescribe by
      regulations. The provisions of subdivisions (b), (c),  (d)  and  (e)  of
      this section shall apply for the purposes of this subdivision, except to
      the  extent  that  any  of  such provisions may be inconsistent with the
      provisions of section 11-1718, and except  that  the  term  "individual"
      shall be read as "trust", the term "city adjusted gross income" shall be
    
      read  as  "city  taxable  income", reference to "gain" shall include any
      modification for includible  gain  under  subdivision  five  of  section
      11-1718,  and  the  phrase  "personal exemptions allowable under section
      11-1716"  shall  be  read  as  "city  exemptions allowable under section
      11-1718."
        (h) Lump sum distributions. If the status of a taxpayer  changes  from
      city  resident  to  city  nonresident,  or from city nonresident to city
      resident, the taxpayer  shall,  regardless  of  his  or  her  method  of
      accounting,  accrue  the total taxable amount of a lump sum distribution
      accruing prior to the change of status, if the ordinary  income  portion
      thereof  is  not  otherwise subject to tax under section 11-1703 for the
      portion of the taxable year prior to the change in status or for a prior
      taxable year. No ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution  the
      total taxable amount of which is accrued under this subdivision shall be
      subject  to tax under section 11-1703 for any subsequent taxable period.
      The accrual under this subdivision shall not be required if the taxpayer
      files with the tax commission a bond or other security acceptable to the
      tax commission, conditioned  upon  the  payment  of  tax  under  section
      11-1703,  with  respect to such amount accruable under this subdivision,
      for a subsequent taxable year as if the taxpayer  had  not  changed  its
      resident status.
        (i)  Deduction  for  two-earner  married  couples.  Where  a return is
      required under this section, the amount  of  deduction  under  paragraph
      twenty-nine  of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712 shall be equal to ten
      percent of the lesser of:
        (1) thirty thousand dollars, pro rated according to the period covered
      by the return or
        (2) the qualified earned income of the spouse with the lower qualified
      earned income for the period covered by the return.

      phrase "section 6512(b), 7121, or 7122" shall be  read  as  "subdivision
      fifteenth,  eighteenth,  eighteenth-a  or  eighteenth-d  of  section one
      hundred seventy-one of the  tax  law  and  subdivision  (b)  of  section
      11-1789 of this chapter".
        (10)  The  following  provisions  of such section six thousand fifteen
      shall be disregarded: (A) The phrase "notwithstanding the provisions  of
      section  7421(a)"  contained  in  clause  (ii)  of  subparagraph  (B) of
      paragraph one of subsection (e); and (B) subparagraph (C)  of  paragraph
      three of subsection (e).
        (c)  Federal  determination. If an individual is relieved of a federal
      income tax liability pursuant to subsection (b) of section six  thousand
      fifteen  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  there  shall be a rebuttable
      presumption that such individual shall also be  entitled  to  equivalent
      relief  from  liability  under  this  section,  to  the extent that such
      individual has an understatement of tax under this chapter for the  same
      taxable year that is attributable to the same erroneous item or items to
      which the individual's federal income tax liability was attributable.

Section 11-1757 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1757  Extensions  of  time.  (a)  General.  The  commissioner of
      taxation and finance may  grant  a  reasonable  extension  of  time  for
      payment  of tax or estimated tax (or any installment), or for filing any
      return, statement, or other document required pursuant to this  chapter,
      on  such  terms  and conditions as it may require. Except for a taxpayer
      who is outside the United States or who  intends  to  claim  nonresident
      status  pursuant  to clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of
      subdivision (b) of section 11-1705, no such  extension  for  filing  any
      return, statement or other document, shall exceed six months.
        (b)  Furnishing  of  security. If any extension of time is granted for
      payment of any amount  of  tax,  the  tax  commission  may  require  the
      taxpayer  to furnish a bond or other security in an amount not exceeding
      twice the amount for which the extension of time for payment is  granted
      on such terms and conditions as the tax commission may require.

Section 11-1758 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1758  Requirements  concerning  returns,  notices,  records  and
      statements. (a) General. The tax commission may prescribe regulations as
      to the  keeping  of  records,  the  content  and  form  of  returns  and
      statements,  and  the filing of copies of federal income tax returns and
      determinations. The tax commission may require any person, by regulation
      or notice served upon such person, to make  such  returns,  render  such
      statements,  or  keep  such  records,  as  the  tax  commission may deem
      sufficient to show whether or not  such  person  is  liable  under  this
      chapter for tax or for collection of tax.
        (b)  Identifying  numbers. (1) When required by regulations prescribed
      by the tax commission:
        (A) Inclusion in returns. Any person required under the  authority  of
      this  chapter  to  make  a  return,  statement,  or other document shall
      include in such return, statement or  other  document  such  identifying
      number  as  may be prescribed for securing proper identification of such
      person.
        (B) Furnishing number to other persons. Any  person  with  respect  to
      whom  a  return,  statement  or  other  document  is  required under the
      authority of this chapter to be made by another person shall furnish  to
      such  other  person  such  identifying  number  as may be prescribed for
      securing his or her proper identification.
        (C) Furnishing number of another person. Any person required under the
      authority of this chapter to make a return, statement, or other document
      with respect to another person shall request from such other person, and
      shall include in any such return, statement,  or  other  document,  such
      identifying   number   as   may   be   prescribed  for  securing  proper
      identification of such other person.
        (2) Limitation.
        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a  return  of  any  person
      with  respect to his or her liability for tax, or any statement or other
      document in support thereof, shall not be  considered  for  purposes  of
      subparagraphs  (B)  and  (C)  of  paragraph one of this subdivision as a
      return, statement or other document with respect to another person.
        (B) For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph one of this
      subdivision, a return  of  an  estate  or  trust  with  respect  to  its
      liability  for  tax,  and  any  statement  or  other document in support
      thereof, shall be considered as a return, statement, or  other  document
      with respect to each beneficiary of such estate or trust.
        (3)  Requirement of information. For purposes of this section, the tax
      commission is authorized to require such information as may be necessary
      to assign an identifying number to any person.
        (c) Partnerships and S corporations.
        (1) Partnerships. Every partnership having  a  city  resident  partner
      shall  make  a  return  for  the taxable year setting forth all items of
      income, gain, loss and deduction and such other pertinent information as
      the tax commission may by regulations and instructions  prescribe.  Such
      return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
      following  the  close  of each taxable year except that the due date for
      the return of a partnership consisting entirely  of  nonresident  aliens
      shall  be  the date prescribed for the filing of its federal partnership
      return for the taxable year. For purposes of  this  paragraph,  "taxable
      year"  means  a  year  or  a period which would be a taxable year of the
      partnership if it were subject to tax under this chapter.
        (2) S  corporations.  Every  S  corporation  for  which  the  election
      provided  for  in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of the tax
      law is in effect shall make a return setting forth all items of  income,
      loss  and  deduction  and  such  other  pertinent information as the tax
      commission may by regulations and instructions  prescribe.  Such  return
    
      shall  be  filed  on  or  before  the  fifteenth  day of the third month
      following the close of each taxable year.
        (d)   Information   at   source.  The  tax  commission  may  prescribe
      regulations and instructions requiring returns of information to be made
      and filed on or before February twenty-eighth of each  year  as  to  the
      payment  or  crediting  in  any  calendar year of amounts of six hundred
      dollars or more to any taxpayer under this chapter. Such returns may  be
      required  of  any  persons,  including  lessees or mortgagors of real or
      personal  property,  fiduciaries,  employers,  and  all   officers   and
      employees  of  this  state, or of any municipal corporation or political
      subdivision  of  this  state,  having  the  control,  receipt,  custody,
      disposal  or  payment  of  interest,  rents,  salaries, wages, premiums,
      annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments or  other  fixed  or
      determinable  gains,  profits or income, except interest coupons payable
      to bearer. A duplicate of the statement as to  tax  withheld  on  wages,
      required to be furnished by an employer to an employee, shall constitute
      the  return  of  information required to be made under this section with
      respect to such wages.
        (e) Notice of qualification as receiver, etc. Every receiver,  trustee
      in  bankruptcy,  assignee  for  benefit  of  creditors,  or  other  like
      fiduciary shall give notice of his or her qualification as such  to  the
      tax commission, as may be required by regulation.
        (g) Requirements applicable to tax return preparer.
        (1)  Signature  of  tax  return  preparer. Any individual who is a tax
      return preparer and prepares any return or claim for refund, shall  sign
      such  return  or  claim  for  refund  in  accordance with regulations or
      instructions prescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance.
        (2) Furnishing identifying numbers. Any return  or  claim  for  refund
      which is prepared by a tax return preparer shall include the identifying
      number  of the preparer required by paragraph one of this subdivision to
      sign such return or claim for refund. In addition, where such individual
      preparer is an employee of an employer which is a  tax  return  preparer
      with  respect to such return or claim for refund, or where such preparer
      is a partner in a partnership  which  is  a  tax  return  preparer  with
      respect  to  such  return or claim for refund, then such return or claim
      for refund shall also include the identifying number of such employer or
      partnership. Such identifying numbers shall  be  as  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  in  order to secure the proper
      identification of such individual preparer, partnership of employer. The
      responsibility for the inclusion of such identifying numbers shall be as
      set forth in paragraph two of subdivision (t) of section 11-1785.
        (3) Furnishing copy to taxpayer.  Any  person  who  is  a  tax  return
      preparer  with respect to any return or claim for refund shall furnish a
      completed copy of such return or claim for refund to  the  taxpayer  not
      later  than  the  time  such return or claim for refund is presented for
      such taxpayer's signature.
        (4) Copy or list to be retained by tax return preparer. Any person who
      is a tax return preparer with respect to any return or claim for  refund
      shall  for  a three year retention period described in paragraph nine of
      this subdivision:
        (A) retain a completed copy of such return or  claim  for  refund,  or
      retain,  on  a  list, the name and identification number of the taxpayer
      for whom such return or claim was prepared, and
        (B) make such copy or list available for inspection  upon  request  by
      the commissioner of taxation and finance.
        (5)  Tax  return  preparer  defined. For purposes of this chapter, the
      term  "tax  return  preparer"  means  any  person   who   prepares   for
      compensation,  or  who employs or engages one or more persons to prepare
    
      for compensation any return or claim for refund. The  preparation  of  a
      substantial  portion of a return or claim for refund shall be treated as
      if it were the preparation of such return or claim for refund. Where  an
      employer  and  one  or  more  employees  of such employer are tax return
      preparers with respect to the same return or claim for refund, or  where
      a  partnership  and  one  or  more  partners in such partnership are tax
      return preparers with respect to the same return or  claim  for  refund,
      for  purposes  of  paragraphs  three  and four of this subdivision, such
      employer or such partnership shall be deemed to be the sole  tax  return
      preparer.  A  person shall not be a "tax return preparer" merely because
      such person--
        (A) furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance,
        (B) prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer  (or  of  an
      officer  or  employee  of  the  employer)  by  whom  he is regularly and
      continuously employed, or
        (C) prepares as a fiduciary a return  or  claim  for  refund  for  any
      person.
        (6)  Person  defined.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the term
      "person" includes an  individual,  corporation  (including  a  dissolved
      corporation) or partnership.
        (7)  Return  defined.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the term
      "return" shall mean any return required under this chapter.
        (8) Claim for refund defined. For purposes of  this  subdivision,  the
      term  "claim  for  refund"  shall  mean  a claim for refund of or credit
      against any tax imposed under this chapter, and shall include any  claim
      for  refund  of  any  credit treated as an overpayment of tax under this
      chapter.
        (9) Retention period defined. For purposes of  this  subdivision,  the
      term "retention period" shall mean: (A) in the case of a tax return, the
      period ending the later of three years after the due date of such return
      (without regard to extensions) or three years after the date such return
      was presented to the taxpayer for such taxpayer's signature, and
        (B)  in  the case of a claim for refund, the period ending three years
      after such claim for refund was  presented  to  the  taxpayer  for  such
      taxpayer's signature.
        * (10)  Mandatory  electronic  filing by certain tax return preparers.
      (A)(i) If a tax return preparer prepared more than two hundred  original
      returns  during  the  calendar  year  beginning  on  January  first, two
      thousand five, and if, in the calendar year beginning on January  first,
      two  thousand  six,  such  tax  return  preparer  prepares  one  or more
      authorized returns using tax software, then, for such calendar year  two
      thousand  six  and  for  each  subsequent  calendar year thereafter, all
      authorized returns prepared by such tax return preparer shall  be  filed
      electronically,  in  accordance  with  instructions  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner of taxation and finance.
        (ii) If a tax return preparer prepared more than one hundred  original
      returns  during  any  calendar year beginning on or after January first,
      two thousand six, and if, in  any  succeeding  calendar  year  such  tax
      return  preparer  prepares  one  or  more  authorized  returns using tax
      software,  then,  for  such  succeeding  calendar  year  and  for   each
      subsequent  calendar year thereafter, all authorized returns prepared by
      such tax return preparer shall be filed  electronically,  in  accordance
      with  instructions  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
      finance.
        (B) For purposes of this paragraph:
        (i) "Electronic" means computer technology;  provided,  however,  that
      the  commissioner  of taxation and finance may, in instructions, provide
    
      that  use  of  barcode  technology  will  also  satisfy  the   mandatory
      electronic filing requirements of this section.
        (ii)  "Authorized return" means any return required under this article
      which the commissioner of taxation and  finance  has  authorized  to  be
      filed electronically.
        (iii)  "Original  return"  means  a return required under this article

      tax return preparation purposes.

Section 11-1759 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1759 Report of federal changes, corrections or disallowances. If
      the amount of a taxpayer's federal taxable income, federal items of  tax
      preference,  total  taxable  amount or ordinary income portion of a lump
      sum distribution or includible gain of a trust reported on  his  federal
      income  tax  return  for any taxable year, or the amount of any claim of
      right adjustment, is changed or corrected by the United States  internal
      revenue  service  or  other  competent  authority, or as the result of a
      renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the United States or the
      amount an employer is required to deduct and  withhold  from  wages  for
      federal  income tax withholding purposes is changed or corrected by such
      service or authority or if a taxpayer's claim for credit  or  refund  of
      federal  income  tax  is disallowed in whole or in part, the taxpayer or
      employer shall report such change or correction or  disallowance  within
      ninety  days  after  the final determination of such change, correction,
      renegotiation,  or  disallowance,  or  as  otherwise  required  by   the
      commissioner,  and  shall  concede the accuracy of such determination or
      state wherein it is erroneous. The allowance of  a  tentative  carryback
      adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback pursuant to section
      sixty-four  hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be treated
      as a final determination for purposes  of  this  section.  Any  taxpayer
      filing  an  amended federal income tax return and any employer filing an
      amended federal return of income tax withheld  shall  also  file  within
      ninety  days  thereafter an amended return under this chapter, and shall
      give such information as the commissioner may require. The  commissioner
      may  by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this
      section as he or she deems appropriate. For purposes  of  this  section,
      (i)  the  term  "taxpayer" shall include a partnership having a resident
      partner or having any income  derived  from  New  York  sources,  and  a
      corporation  with  respect  to  which  the  taxable year of such change,
      correction, disallowance or amendment is a year with  respect  to  which
      the election provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty
      of  the  tax  law  is  in  effect, and (ii) the term "federal income tax
      return" shall include the returns of income required under sections  six
      thousand  thirty-one  and  six  thousand  thirty-seven  of  the internal
      revenue code. In the case of such a corporation, such report shall  also
      include  any  change  or correction of the taxes described in paragraphs
      two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of
      the internal  revenue  code.  Reports  made  under  this  section  by  a
      partnership  or  corporation shall indicate the portion of the change in
      each item of income, gain, loss or deduction (and,  in  the  case  of  a
      corporation, of each change in, or disallowance of a claim for credit or
      refund  of,  a  tax  referred to in the preceding sentence) allocable to
      each partner  or  shareholder  and  shall  set  forth  such  identifying
      information  with  respect  to  such  partner  or  shareholder as may be
      prescribed by the commissioner.

Section 11-1762 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1762  Computation  of  tax  where  taxpayer restores substantial
      amount held under claim of right. (a) General. If:
        (1) an item was included in city adjusted gross  income  for  a  prior
      taxable  year  (or  years)  because it appeared that the taxpayer had an
      unrestricted right to such item, and
        (2) for the current taxable year the provisions of paragraph  five  of
      subsection  (a)  of  section  thirteen hundred forty-one of the internal
      revenue code apply to such item, then the tax imposed  by  this  chapter
      for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to
        (3)  the  tax  for  the  taxable  year computed without regard to this
      section, minus
        (4) the decrease in tax under this chapter for the prior taxable  year
      (or years) which would result solely from the exclusion of such item (or
      portion  thereof) from city adjusted gross income for such prior taxable
      year (or years).
        (b) Special rules. If the decrease in tax ascertained under  paragraph
      four  of subdivision (a) of this section exceeds the tax imposed by this
      chapter for the taxable year, such excess shall be considered a  payment
      of  tax on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the
      taxable year, and shall be refunded or credited in the same manner as if
      it were an overpayment for such taxable year.
