      contained  within  such  period  of five hundred forty-eight consecutive
    
      days, he or she is present in the city for a number of days  which  does
      not  exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to ninety as the number
      of days contained in such period of less than  twelve  months  bears  to
      five hundred forty-eight, or
        (2)  who  is not domiciled in the city but maintains a permanent place

      was transferred to the trust but has subsequently become irrevocable.
        For  the  purposes  of the foregoing, a trust or portion of a trust is
      revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any
      future time, to revest title in the person  whose  property  constitutes
      such  trust  or  portion  of  a trust, and a trust or portion of a trust

        (k)  Nonresident  estate or trust. A nonresident estate or trust means
      an estate or trust which is not a resident.

      this  chapter  shall  have the same meaning as when used in a comparable
      context in the laws of the United States relating to federal  taxes  but
      such  meaning  shall  be  subject  to  the  exceptions  or modifications
      prescribed in or pursuant to article two-E of the general city law or by
      the laws of this state. Any reference in this chapter  to  the  internal
      revenue  code,  the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred eighty-six
      or to the laws of the United States shall mean  the  provisions  of  the
      internal revenue code of nineteen hundred eighty-six (unless a reference
      to  the  internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four is clearly
      intended), and amendments thereto, and other provisions of the  laws  of
      the United States relating to federal taxes, as the same are included in
      the  appendix  and  supplement  to  the  appendix  to this chapter. (The
      quotation of the aforesaid laws of the United States is intended to make
      them a part of this chapter and to  avoid  constitutional  uncertainties
      which  might  result if such laws were merely incorporated by reference.
      The quotation of a provision of the federal internal revenue code or  of
      any other law of the United States shall not necessarily mean that it is
      applicable to or has relevance to this chapter).
        (m)  With  respect  to  any taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred
      seventy, until and including the thirty-first day of December,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-one,  "administrator"  shall  be  read  as  "state  tax
      commission"; "administrative agencies of the  city"  shall  be  read  as
      "administrative  agencies  of  the  state";  "depositories  or financial
      agents of the city" shall be read as "depositories or  financial  agents

      department  of  taxation  and  finance";  in  sections 11-1934, 11-1936,
      11-1939,  and  11-1942  of  this  chapter  (except for the last sentence
      thereof) of this chapter "city" shall be read as  "state";  "corporation
      counsel  or  other  appropriate  officer  of  the  city" or "corporation
      counsel of the city" shall be read as "state attorney general"; and  the
      words  "it"  or "its" shall apply instead of the pronouns used where the
      reference is to tax  commission.  Provided,  however,  with  respect  to
      declarations  of  estimated  tax  and  payments  of  such  tax  and  the
      withholding tax requirements, until and including the  thirty-first  day
      of  December,  nineteen  hundred seventy-one, any such terms shall be so
      read with respect to any taxable  year  or  other  period  beginning  in
      nineteen hundred seventy-one.
        (n)  The  term "partnership" shall include, unless a different meaning
      is clearly required, a subchapter K limited liability company. The  term
      "subchapter  K limited liability company" shall mean a limited liability
      company classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The
      term "limited liability company"  means  a  domestic  limited  liability
      company  or  a  foreign limited liability company, as defined in section
      one hundred  two  of  the  limited  liability  company  law,  a  limited
      liability  investment  company  formed  pursuant to section five hundred
      seven of the banking law, or a limited liability  trust  company  formed
      pursuant to section one hundred two-a of the banking law.

Section 11-1903 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1903 Taxable years to which tax imposed by this chapter applies;
      tax for taxable years beginning prior to and ending  after  July  first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six. (a) General. The tax imposed by this chapter
      is  imposed for each taxable year beginning with taxable years ending on
      or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.
        (b) Alternate methods for determining tax for taxable years ending  on
      or  after  July  first,  nineteen hundred sixty-six. (1) The tax for any
      taxable year ending on or after July first, nineteen  hundred  sixty-six
      and  on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, shall be
      the same part of the tax which would have been imposed had this  chapter
      been  in  effect for the entire taxable year as the number of months (or
      major portions thereof) of the taxable year occurring after July  first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-six is of the number of months (or major portions
      thereof) in the taxable year.
        (2)(i)  In  lieu  of  the  method  of computation of tax prescribed in
      paragraph one of this subdivision, if the  taxpayer  maintains  adequate
      records  for  any  taxable  year ending on or after July first, nineteen
      hundred sixty-six and on or  before  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-seven,  the  tax  for  such  taxable  year, at the election of the
      taxpayer, may be computed on the basis of the wages which  the  taxpayer
      would  have reported had he or she filed a federal income tax return for
      a taxable year beginning July first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  and
      ending  with  the  close  of  such taxable year ending on or before June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred  sixty-seven,  and  the  net  earnings  from
      self-employment  which  the  taxpayer  would  have  reported for federal
      income tax purposes had he or she filed a self-employment tax return for
      a taxable year beginning July  first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  and
      ending  with  the  close  of  such taxable year ending on or before June
      thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven.
        (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the  exclusions  allowable  under
      section  11-1902  of this subchapter shall be reduced by a fraction, the
      numerator of which is the number of months (or major  portions  thereof)
      of  the  taxable  year  occurring  before  July  first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-six, and the denominator of which is  the  number  of  months  (or
      major  portions thereof) in the taxable year. Except as provided in this
      paragraph, the tax for such period ending on or before  June  thirtieth,
      nineteen  hundred  sixty-seven, shall be computed in accordance with the
      other provisions of this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1904
---------------

Section 11-1904 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1904  Allocation  to the city. (a) General. If net earnings from
      self-employment are derived from services performed,  or  from  sources,
      within and without the city, there shall be allocated to the city a fair
      and equitable portion of such earnings.
        (b) Allocation of net earnings from self-employment.
        (1)  Place of business. If a taxpayer has no regular place of business
      outside the city all of his or her  net  earnings  from  self-employment
      shall be allocated to the city.
        (2)  Allocation  by taxpayer's books. The portion of net earnings from
      self-employment allocable to the city may be determined from  the  books
      and  records  of  a taxpayer's trade or business, if the methods used in
      keeping such  books  and  the  accuracy  thereof  are  approved  by  the
      commissioner  as  fairly  and  equitably  reflecting  net  earnings from
      self-employment within the city.
        (3) Allocation by formula. If paragraph two of this  subdivision  does
      not   apply   to   the  taxpayer,  the  portion  of  net  earnings  from
      self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined by multiplying
      (A) net earnings from self-employment within and without  the  city,  by
      (B) the average of the following three percentages:
        (i)  Property  percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the
      average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable  year,  of
      real  and  tangible  personal  property connected with net earnings from
      self-employment and located within the city, by (B) the average  of  the
      value,  at  the  beginning  and end of the taxable year, of all real and
      tangible  personal  property  connected  with  the  net  earnings   from
      self-employment  and  located both within and without the city. For this
      purpose, real property shall include  real  property  whether  owned  or
      rented.
        (ii)  Payroll  percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the
      total wages, salaries and other personal service  compensation  paid  or
      incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the net
      earnings  from  self-employment derived from a trade or business carried
      on within the city, by (B) the total of all wages,  salaries  and  other
      personal  service  compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year
      to employees in connection with the net  earnings  from  self-employment
      derived  from a trade or business carried on both within and without the
      city.
        (iii) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A)
      the gross sales or charges for  services  performed  by  or  through  an
      agency  located  within the city, by (B) the total of all gross sales or
      charges for services performed within and without the city. The sales or
      charges to be allocated to the city shall include all  sales  negotiated
      or  consummated,  and  charges  for  services performed, by an employee,
      agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly situated  at,  connected
      by  contract  or  otherwise  with,  or  sent  out from, offices or other
      agencies of the trade or business from which a taxpayer is deriving  net
      earnings from self-employment, situated within the city.
        (c)  Other  allocation  methods.  The  portion  of  net  earnings from
      self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined in  accordance
      with rules and regulations of the commissioner if it shall appear to the
      commissioner  that  the net earnings from self-employment are not fairly
      and equitably reflected under the provisions of subdivision (b) of  this
      section.
        (d)  Special  rules  for  real  estate. Income and deductions from the
      rental of real property and gain and loss from  the  sale,  exchange  or
      other  disposition  of real property, shall not be subject to allocation
      under subdivision (b) or (c) of this section, but shall be considered as
    
      entirely derived from or connected with the place in which such property
      is located.

Section 11-1905 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1905  Accounting  periods and methods. (a) Accounting periods. A
      taxpayer's taxable year under this chapter shall be the same as  his  or
      her taxable year for federal income tax purposes.
        (b)  Change  of  accounting  periods.  If a taxpayer's taxable year is
      changed for federal income tax purposes, his or  her  taxable  year  for
      purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed. If a taxable period
      of  less  than  twelve months results from a change of taxable year, the
      exclusion allowable under section 11-1902 of this  subchapter  shall  be
      prorated under regulations of the commissioner.
        (c)  Accounting  methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this
      chapter shall be the same as his or her method of accounting for federal
      income tax purposes. In the absence of  any  method  of  accounting  for
      federal  income  tax  purposes, net earnings from self-employment within
      the city shall be computed under such method as in the  opinion  of  the
      commissioner  clearly  reflects net earnings from self-employment within
      the city.
        (d) Change of accounting  methods.  (1)  If  a  taxpayer's  method  of
      accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes, his or her method
      of accounting for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed.
        (2)  If  a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other than from
      an accrual to an installment method, any additional  tax  which  results
      from  adjustments  determined  to  be  necessary solely by reason of the
      change shall not be  greater  than  if  such  adjustments  were  ratably
      allocated  and  included  for  the  taxable  year  of the change and the
      preceding taxable years, beginning after July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six,  not  in  excess  of  two, during which the taxpayer used the
      method of accounting from which the change is made.
        (3) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to
      an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of
      method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the  receipt
      of  installment  payments  properly  accrued  in  a prior year, shall be
      reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to
      the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations
      of the commissioner.

      period beginning  August  twenty-seventh,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,
      every employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this
      state  and  making payment of any wages taxable under this chapter shall
      deduct and withhold from such  wages  for  each  payroll  period  a  tax
      computed  in  such  manner  as  to  result,  so  far  as practicable, in
      withholding from the employee's  wages  during  each  calendar  year  an
      amount  substantially  equivalent  to the tax reasonably estimated to be
      due from the employee under this chapter. The method of determining  the
      amount  to  be  withheld  shall  be  prescribed  by  regulations  of the
      commissioner.

Section 11-1909. ::    
        
     
        §  11-1909. Withholding of tax on wages for taxable periods commencing
      on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-six. The  provisions
      contained  in  sections  11-1908, 11-1910, 11-1911, 11-1912, 11-1913 and
      11-1914 of this subchapter shall not be applicable to taxes imposed  for
      taxable  periods  commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred
      seventy-six  provided  however,  with  respect  to  such  periods,   the
      provisions  contained  in  part  V  of article twenty-two of the tax law
      shall be  applicable  with  the  same  force  and  effect  as  if  those
      provisions  had  been  incorporated in full in this section except where
      inconsistent with the provisions of article two-E of  the  general  city
      law,  except  that  the  term "aggregate amount" contained in paragraphs
      one, two and three of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four
      of the tax law shall mean  the  aggregate  amounts  of  New  York  state
      personal income tax, city earnings tax on nonresidents and city personal
      income tax on residents authorized pursuant to article thirty of the tax
      law required to be deducted and withheld and provided, however, that the
      provisions  of  such  paragraphs  shall  not be applicable to employer's
      returns required to be filed  with  respect  to  taxes  required  to  be
      deducted   and  withheld  during  the  calendar  year  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-six, but such returns shall be required to be filed with the tax
      commission at the times and in the manner provided  for  in  subdivision
      (a)  of section 11-1912 of this chapter, except the term "commission" in
      such subdivision shall be read as "tax commission." This  section  shall
      not  apply  to  payments  by  the United States for service in the armed
      forces of the United States so long as the right  to  require  deduction
      and  withholding  of tax from such payments is prohibited by the laws of
      the United States. Service in the armed  forces  of  the  United  States
      shall  have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the
      laws of the United States relating to withholding of city income taxes.

      paid on behalf of the employee from whom  withheld,  and  such  employee
      shall  be  credited with having paid that amount of tax in such calendar
      year. For a taxable year of less than twelve months, the credit shall be

Section 11-1912 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1912  Employer's  return  and  payment  of  withheld  taxes. (a)
      General.   On  or  after  the  first  payroll  period  beginning  August
      twenty-seventh,  nineteen  hundred sixty-six, every employer required to
      deduct and withhold tax under this  chapter  shall,  for  each  calendar
      month,  on  or before the fifteenth day of the month following the close
      of such calendar month file a withholding return as  prescribed  by  the
      commissioner  and  pay  over  to  the  commissioner or to the depository
      designated by the commissioner, the taxes so required to be deducted and
      withheld, except that for the month of December in any year the  returns
      shall  be  filed and the taxes paid on or before January thirty-first of
      the succeeding year. Where the aggregate amount required to be  deducted
      and  withheld  by  any  employer  under  this  chapter and under chapter
      seventeen of this title is less than twenty-five dollars in  a  calendar
      month  and the aggregate of such taxes for the semi-annual period ending
      on June thirtieth and December thirty-first can reasonably  be  expected
      to  be  less  than  one  hundred fifty dollars, the commissioner may, by
      regulation, permit an employer to  file  a  return  on  or  before  July
      thirty-first  for the semi-annual period ending on June thirtieth and on
      or before January thirty-first for  the  semi-annual  period  ending  on
      December  thirty-first. The commissioner may, if he or she believes such
      action necessary  for  the  protection  of  the  revenues,  require  any
      employer  to  make  a  return and pay to him or her the tax deducted and
      withheld at any time, or from time to time. Where the  amount  of  wages
      paid  by  an  employer  is  not  sufficient under this chapter and under
      chapter seventeen of this title to require the withholding of  tax  from
      the  wages  of  any  of  his  or her employees, the commissioner may, by
      regulation, permit such employer to file an annual return on  or  before
      February twenty-eighth of the following calendar year.
        (b)  Combined  returns. The commissioner may by regulation provide for
      the filing of one return which shall include the return required  to  be
      filed  under  this section, together with the employer's return required
      to be filed under chapter seventeen of this title.
        (c) Deposit in trust for city. Whenever any employer fails to collect,
      truthfully account for, pay over the tax, or make returns of the tax  as
      required  in this section, the commissioner may serve a notice requiring
      such employer to  collect  the  taxes  which  become  collectible  after
      service  of such notice, to deposit such taxes in a bank approved by the
      commissioner, in a separate account, in trust for the city  and  payable
      to  the commissioner, and to keep the amount of such tax in such account
      until payment over to the commissioner.  Such  notice  shall  remain  in
      effect until a notice of cancellation is served by the commissioner.

---------------

Section 11-1913 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1913  Employer's  liability  for  withheld taxes. Every employer
      required to deduct and withhold the tax under  this  chapter  is  hereby
      made liable for such tax. For purposes of assessment and collection, any
      amount  required  to  be withheld and paid over to the commissioner, and
      any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto  shall
      be  considered  the  tax  of  the  employer.  Any amount of tax actually
      deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be held to be  a  special
      fund  in  trust for the city. No employee shall have any right of action
      against his or her employer  in  respect  to  any  monies  deducted  and
      withheld  from  his  or  her  wages and paid over to the commissioner in
      compliance or in intended compliance with this chapter.

      deduct and withhold the tax, as required, and thereafter the tax against
      which such tax may be credited is  paid,  the  tax  so  required  to  be
      deducted  and withheld shall not be collected from the employer, but the
      employer shall  not  be  relieved  from  liability  for  any  penalties,
      interest or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such
      failure to deduct and withhold.

      tax commission may require:

        (A)  A combined return which in addition to the return provided for in
      this chapter may also include returns required to be filed under  a  law
      authorized by article thirty of the tax law and under article twenty-two
      of the tax law.

      return provided for by this chapter may also include employer's  returns
      required to be filed under a law authorized by article thirty of the tax
      law and under article twenty-two of the tax law.
        (2) Where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with
      respect  to  the  payment of estimated tax, the state tax commission may
      also require payment of a single amount which shall be the total of  the
      amounts  (total  taxes  less any credits or refunds) required to be paid
      with the returns or employer's returns or in payment  of  estimated  tax
      pursuant  to the provisions of this chapter, a law authorized by article
      thirty of the  tax  law  and  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  article
      twenty-two of the tax law.
