Subchapter 3 - PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION
===========================================

Section 11-1923
---------------

Section 11-1923 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1923 Notice of deficiency. (a) General. If upon examination of a
      taxpayer's return under this chapter the  commissioner  determines  that
      there  is a deficiency of tax, he or she may mail a notice of deficiency
      to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file  a  return  required  under
      this  chapter, the commissioner is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's
      wages and net earnings from self-employment  or  the  wages  from  which
      taxes are required to be deducted and withheld and the tax thereon, from
      any  information  in the commissioner's possession, and to mail a notice
      of deficiency to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by
      certified or registered mail to the taxpayer  at  such  taxpayer's  last
      known  address  in  or  out  of the city. If the taxpayer is deceased or
      under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to or her
      last know address in or out of the city,  unless  the  commissioner  has
      received  notice  of  the  existence  of  a  fiduciary relationship with
      respect to the taxpayer.
        (b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. The notice of deficiency shall
      be an assessment of the amount of tax specified in such notice, together
      with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice.
        (c) Restrictions on collection and levy.  No  notice  and  demand  for
      payment  of  an  assessment  of  a deficiency in tax made by a notice of
      deficiency and no levy or proceeding in court for its  collection  shall
      be  made,  begun  or prosecuted, except as otherwise provided in section
      11-1937 of this subchapter, until the expiration of the time for  filing
      a  petition  contesting  such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to
      the taxable year  has  been  filed  with  the  commissioner,  until  the
      decision of the commissioner has become final. After a petition has been
      filed  the  restriction  provided herein shall not apply to such part of
      the deficiency as is not contested by the petition. For exception in the
      case of judicial  review  of  the  decision  of  the  commissioner,  see
      subdivision (c) of section 11-1932 of this subchapter.
        (d)  Exceptions  for  mathematical  errors.  If  a  mathematical error
      appears on a return (including an overstatement of the  credit  for  tax
      withheld  at  the  source  or  of the amount paid as estimated tax), the
      commissioner shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax  in  excess
      of  that  shown  upon  the  return is due, and that such excess has been
      assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of  deficiency
      for  the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1929 of
      this subchapter (limiting credits  or  refunds  after  petition  to  the
      commissioner),  or subdivision (b) of section 11-1931 of this subchapter
      (authorizing the filing of a petition with the commissioner based  on  a
      notice  of  deficiency)  nor  shall  collection  of  such  assessment be
      prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.
        (e) Exception where change in federal or New York state taxable income
      is not reported (1) If the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-1922
      of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction  increasing  his
      or  her  federal  or  New  York  state taxable income or self-employment
      income as reported on such taxpayer's federal  or  New  York  state  tax
      return  or  in  not reporting a change or correction which is treated in
      the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state
      tax purposes or in not filing an amended return or in not reporting  the
      execution  of  a  notice  of  waiver  or an assessment described in such
      section, instead of the mode  and  time  of  assessment  and  collection
      provided  for  in  subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner may
      assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected federal or  New
      York  state  taxable  income or self-employment income by mailing to the
      taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying  the  amount  of  the
      deficiency,  and  such deficiency, together with the interest, additions
      to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed and
    
      subject to collection procedures on  the  date  such  notice  is  mailed
      unless  within  thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of
      the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return,
      where  such  return  was  required by section 11-1922 of this chapter is
      filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein  such  federal  or  New
      York  state  determination  of  such  notice  of  additional tax due are
      erroneous.
        (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency  for
      the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1929 of this
      subchapter   (limiting   credits   or  refunds  after  petition  to  the
      commissioner), or subdivision (b) of section 11-1931 of this  subchapter
      (authorizing  the  filing of a petition with the commissioner based on a
      notice of deficiency), nor shall the collection of  such  assessment  be
      prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.
        If  the  taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of
      additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in  or
      out  of  the  city,  unless  the commissioner has received notice of the
      existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.
        (f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any  time  have  the
      right  to  waive the mailing of a notice of deficiency or restriction on
      collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency,  or  both,  by  a
      signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner.
        (g)  Deficiency  defined.  For  purposes of this chapter, a deficiency
      means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (1) the amount
      shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made
      or the tax computed by the taxpayer or by the commissioner),  and  less,
      (2) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as
      a  deficiency and plus (3) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of
      this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the  tax  shown  on
      the  return  shall  both  be  determined  without  regard to payments on
      account of estimated tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a rebate
      means so much of an abatement, refund or other repayment (whether or not
      erroneous) made on  the  ground  that  the  amounts  entering  into  the
      definition of a deficiency showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.
        (h)  Cross reference. For provisions permitting a notice of deficiency
      under chapter seventeen of this title to  be  treated  as  a  notice  of
      deficiency under this chapter and permitting a notice of deficiency or a
      payment  for which credit or refund is sought under chapter seventeen of
      this title to be treated as though made under  this  chapter  where  the
      taxpayer  has filed a petition under such chapter seventeen for either a
      redetermination of deficiency or for credit or refund,  see  subdivision
      (h)  of  section  11-1736  of  this title and subdivision (h) of section
      11-1744 of this title.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1924
---------------

Section 11-1924 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1924  Assessment. (a) Assessment date. The amount of tax which a
      return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return  would  have
      shown  to  be  due  but  for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be
      assessed on the date of filing of  the  return  (including  any  amended
      return  showing  an  increase  of tax). In the case of a return properly
      filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by  the  commissioner
      shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment is due. If a
      notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall
      be  deemed  to  be  assessed  on  the  date on which it is mailed. If an
      amended return or report filed  pursuant  to  section  11-1922  of  this
      chapter concedes the accuracy of a federal or New York state adjustment,
      change or correction, any deficiency in tax under this chapter resulting
      therefrom  shall  be  deemed  to  be assessed on the date of filing such
      report  or  amended  return,  and  such  assessment  shall   be   timely
      notwithstanding  section  11-1925  of  this  subchapter.  If a notice of
      additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of section  11-1923
      of  this subchapter, has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall
      be deemed to be assessed on  the  date  specified  in  such  subdivision
      unless  within  thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of
      the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return,
      where such return was required by section 11-1922 of  this  chapter,  is
      filed  accompanied  by  a  statement showing wherein such federal or New
      York state determination and such  notice  of  additional  tax  due  are
      erroneous.  Any  amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than
      amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be
      deemed  to  be  assessed  upon  the  date   of   receipt   of   payment,
      notwithstanding any other provisions.
        (b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of
      any  tax  under  this  chapter (including interest, additions to tax and
      assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided  for,  the  commissioner
      may establish the same by regulations.
        (d)  Supplemental assessment. The commissioner may, at any time within
      the period prescribed for assessment, make  a  supplemental  assessment,
      subject  to  the  provisions of section 11-1923 of this subchapter where
      applicable, whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is  imperfect
      or incomplete in any material respect.
        (e)  Cross  reference. For assessment in case of jeopardy, see section
      11-1937 of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1925
---------------

Section 11-1925 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1925 Limitations on assessment. (a) General. Except as otherwise
      provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall  be  assessed
      within  three  years  after  the  return  was filed (whether or not such
      return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
        (b) Exceptions. (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at
      any time if:
        (A) no return is filed,
        (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or
        (C) the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-1922 of this  chapter
      in not reporting a change or correction increasing his or her federal or
      New  York  state taxable income or self-employment income as reported on
      the taxpayer's federal or New York state tax return, or the execution of
      a notice of waiver and the changes or corrections on which it  is  based
      or  in  not  reporting  an assessment or a change or correction which is
      treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New
      York state income tax purposes, or in not filing an amended return.
        (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of  the  time
      prescribed  in  this  section  for  the  assessment  of  tax,  both  the
      commissioner  and  the  taxpayer  have  consented  in  writing  to   its
      assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to
      the  expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may
      be  extended  by  subsequent  agreements  in  writing  made  before  the
      expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
        (3)  Report  of changed or corrected federal or New York state income.
      If the taxpayer shall, pursuant to  section  11-1922  of  this  chapter,
      report  a  change or correction or file an amended return increasing the
      taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable  income  or  earnings  from
      self-employment  or report an assessment or a change or correction which
      is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal  or
      New  York  state  income  tax purposes, the assessment (if not deemed to
      have been made upon the filing of the report or amended return)  may  be
      made  at  any  time within two years after such report or amended return
      was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax  shall  not  exceed  the
      amount  of  the  increase  in  city tax on earnings attributable to such
      federal or New York state change or correction. The provisions  of  this
      paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which
      an assessment may otherwise be made.
        (4)  Recovery  of  erroneous  refund.  An  erroneous  refund  shall be
      considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of
      a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any  time
      within  two  years  from  the  making  of  the  refund,  except that the
      assessment may be made within five years from the making of  the  refund
      if  it  appears  that  any  part  of  the refund was induced by fraud or
      misrepresentation of a material fact.
        (5) Request for prompt assessment. If  a  return  is  required  for  a
      decedent   or   for   the   decedent's   estate  during  the  period  of
      administration, the tax shall be assessed within eighteen  months  after
      written  request  therefor  (made  after  the  return  is  filed) by the
      executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of  such
      decedent,  but  not  more  than  three years after the return was filed,
      except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (c)  of
      this section.
        (c)  Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at any time
      within six years after the return was filed if a taxpayer omits  from  a
      return  an  amount  properly  includible  therein  which is in excess of
      twenty-five per centum of the amount of the gross income derived by  the
      taxpayer from any trade or business.
    
        For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account
      any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in
      the  return,  or  in  a  statement  attached  to the return, in a manner
      adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and  amount  of  such
      item.
        (d)  Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the
      period of limitations on or collection of tax or other amount (or  of  a
      transferee's  liability)  shall,  after  the  mailing  of  a  notice  of
      deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner is
      prohibited under subdivision (c) of section 11-1923 of  this  subchapter
      collecting by levy or proceeding in court.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1926
---------------

Section 11-1926 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1926 Interest on underpayment. (a) General. If any amount of tax
      is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in  this  chapter  for
      payment, interest on such amount at the appropriate rates prescribed for
      underpayments of tax under chapter seventeen of this title shall be paid
      for  the period from such last date to the date paid, whether or not any
      extension  of  time  for  payment  was  granted.  Interest  under   this
      subdivision  shall  not  be  paid if the amount thereof is less than one
      dollar. If the time for filing a return of tax withheld by  an  employer
      is  extended,  the  employer shall pay interest for the period for which
      the extension is granted  and  may  not  charge  such  interest  to  the
      employee.
        (c)  Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on
      any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer
      files a return within the time prescribed in this chapter (including any
      extension of time) and pays the  amount  of  underpayment  within  three
      months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended.
        (d)  No  interest on interest. No interest under this chapter shall be
      imposed on any interest provided by this chapter.
        (e)  Suspension  of  interest  on  deficiencies.  If   a   waiver   of
      restrictions  on  collection  of  an assessment of a deficiency has been
      filed by the taxpayer, and if notice and demand by the commissioner  for
      payment of such assessed deficiency is not made within thirty days after
      the  filing  of  such  waiver,  interest  shall  not  be imposed on such
      deficiency for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day
      and ending with the date of notice and demand.
        (f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid
      upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in  the
      same  manner as tax. Any reference in this chapter to the tax imposed by
      this chapter shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed  by  this
      section on such tax.
        (g)  Interest  on  penalties  or  additions  to tax. Interest shall be
      imposed under  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  in  respect  of  any
      assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or
      addition  to tax is not paid within ten days from the date of the notice
      and demand therefor under subdivision (b) of  section  11-1934  of  this
      subchapter,  and  in  such  case  interest shall be imposed only for the
      period from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.
        (h) Payment prior to notice of deficiency. If, prior to the mailing to
      the taxpayer of a notice of deficiency under subdivision (b) of  section
      11-1923  of  this  subchapter,  the commissioner mails to the taxpayer a
      notice of proposed increase of tax and within thirty days after the date
      of the notice of proposed increase the taxpayer pays all  amounts  shown
      on  the  notice  to  be  due to the commissioner, no interest under this
      section on the amount so paid shall be imposed for the period after  the
      date of such notice of proposed increase.
        (i) Payment within ninety days after notice of deficiency. If a notice
      of  deficiency under section 11-1923 of this subchapter is mailed to the
      taxpayer, and the total amount specified in such notice is  paid  on  or
      before  the ninetieth day after the date of mailing, interest under this
      section shall not be imposed for  the  period  after  the  date  of  the
      notice.
        (j)  Payment  within  ten  days after notice and demand. If notice and
      demand is made for payment  of  any  amount  under  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-1934  of  this subchapter, and if such amount is paid within
      ten days after the date of such notice and demand, interest  under  this
      section  on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after
      the date of such notice and demand.
    
        (k) Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under
      this section may be assessed and collected at any time during the period
      within which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates  may
      be assessed and collected, respectively.
        (l)  Interest  on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount
      which has been erroneously refunded, and which  is  recoverable  by  the
      commissioner,  shall  bear  interest  at  the rate of six per centum per
      annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only if it appears
      that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or a  misrepresentation
      of a material fact.
        (m)  Satisfaction  by credits. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by
      credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed  under  this
      section  on  the  portion  of the tax so satisfied for any period during
      which, if the credit  had  not  been  made,  interest  would  have  been
      allowable with respect to such overpayment.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1927
---------------

Section 11-1927 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1927  Additions  to tax and civil penalties. (a) Failure to file
      tax return. In case of failure to file a tax return under  this  chapter
      on  or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to any
      extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such  failure  is
      due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
      added to the amount required to be shown as  tax  on  such  return  five
      percent  of  the  amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than
      one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For this purpose,  the  amount  of
      tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of
      any  part  of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for
      payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which
      may be claimed upon the return.
        (b) Deficiency due to negligence. If any part of a deficiency  is  due
      to  negligence  or  intentional  disregard  of  this chapter or rules or
      regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud),  there  shall  be
      added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.
        (c)  Failure  to file declaration or underpayment of estimated tax. If
      any taxpayer fails to file a declaration of estimated tax  or  fails  to
      pay  all  or  any  part of an installment of estimated tax, the taxpayer
      shall be deemed to have made an underpayment  of  estimated  tax.  There
      shall  be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount at the rate of
      six per centum upon the amount of the underpayment for the period of the
      underpayment but not beyond  the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month
      following  the  close  of  the  taxable year. The amount of underpayment
      shall be the excess of the amount of  the  installment  which  would  be
      required  to  be paid if the estimated tax were equal to seventy percent
      of the tax attributable to net earnings from self  employment  shown  on
      the  tax  return for the taxable year (or if no return was filed, of the
      tax so attributable for such year) over  the  amount,  if  any,  of  the
      installment  paid on or before the last day prescribed for such payment.
      No underpayment shall be deemed to exist with respect to  a  declaration
      or installment otherwise due on or after the taxpayer's death.
        (d)  Exception  to  addition  for  underpayment  of estimated tax. The
      addition to tax under subdivision (c) of this section  with  respect  to
      any  underpayment  of  any installment shall not be imposed if the total
      amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last  date
      prescribed  for  the  payment  of  such  installment  equals  or exceeds
      whichever of the following is the lesser:
        (1) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or  before
      such  date  if  the estimated tax were whichever of the following is the
      lesser:
        (A) The tax attributable to net earnings from self-employment shown on
      the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year, if a return
      showing a liability  for  tax  was  filed  by  the  individual  for  the
      preceding  taxable  year  and  such preceding year was a taxable year of
      twelve months, or
        (B) An amount equal to seventy percent of the tax so attributable  for
      the  taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable
      net earnings from self-employment for the months  in  the  taxable  year
      ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.
      For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  the  taxable  net  earnings from
      self-employment shall be placed on an annualized basis by:
        (i) multiplying by twelve (or, in the case of a taxable year  of  less
      than  twelve  months,  the  number  of  months  in the taxable year) the
      taxable net earnings from self-employment for the months in the  taxable
    
      year  ending before the month in which the installment is required to be
      paid,
        (ii)  dividing  the  resulting  amount  by the number of months in the
      taxable year ending before the month  in  which  such  installment  date
      falls, and
        (iii)  deducting  from  such  amount  the  proper  proportion  of  the
      exclusion allowable for the taxable year by subdivision (b)  of  section
      11-1902 of this chapter; or
        (2)  An  amount  equal  to  ninety percent of the tax computed, at the
      rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the actual taxable
      net earnings from self-employment for the months  in  the  taxable  year
      ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.
        (e)  Deficiency  due  to  fraud. If any part of a deficiency is due to
      fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty  percent
      of the deficiency. This amount shall be in lieu of any other addition to
      tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b) of this section.
        (f)  Non-willful  failure  to  pay  withholding  tax. If any employer,
      without intent to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the
      payment thereof, shall fail to make a return and pay a tax  withheld  by
      him  or  her  at  the  time  required  by or under provisions of section
      11-1912 of this chapter, such employer shall be liable for such tax  and
      shall  pay  the  same together with interest thereon and the addition to
      tax provided in subdivision (a) of this section, and such  interest  and
      addition  to  tax shall not be charged to or collected from the employee
      by the employer. The commissioner shall have the same rights and  powers
      for  the  collection  of  such tax, interest and addition to tax against
      such employer as are now prescribed by this chapter for  the  collection
      of tax against an individual taxpayer.
        (g)  Willful  failure to collect and pay over tax. Any person required
      to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax imposed by this
      chapter who willfully fails to collect such tax  or  truthfully  account
      for  and  pay over such tax or willfully attempts in any manner to evade
      or defeat the tax or the payment thereof, shall, in  addition  to  other
      penalties  provided  by  law,  be liable to a penalty equal to the total
      amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or  not  accounted  for  and
      paid  over.  No  addition  to  tax  under subdivision (b) or (e) of this
      section shall be imposed for  any  offense  to  which  this  subdivision
      applies.
        (h)  Failure  to  file  certain  information  returns. In case of each
      failure to file a statement of a payment  to  another  person,  required
      under  authority  of  subdivision (c) of section 11-1921 of this chapter
      (relating to information at source, including the duplicate statement of
      tax withheld on wages) on the date prescribed therefor (determined  with
      regard  to  any  extension  of time for filing), unless it is shown that
      such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful  neglect,  there
      shall, upon notice and demand by the commissioner and in the same manner
      as  tax,  be  paid  by  the  person  so failing to file the statement, a
      penalty of one dollar for each statement not so  filed,  but  the  total
      amount imposed on the delinquent person for all such failures during any
      calendar year shall not exceed one thousand dollars.
        (i)  Additional  penalty.  Any person who with fraudulent intent shall
      fail to pay, or to deduct or withhold and pay,  any  tax,  or  to  make,
      render,  sign  or certify any return or declaration of estimated tax, or
      to supply any information within the time  required  by  or  under  this
      chapter,  shall  be  liable  to  a penalty of not more than one thousand
      dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under  this  chapter,
      to   be  imposed,  assessed  and  collected  by  the  commissioner.  The
    
      commissioner shall have the power, in his or her discretion,  to  waive,
      reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.
        (j)  Additions  treated  as  tax.  The  additions to tax and penalties
      provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and  shall
      be  assessed,  collected  and  paid in the same manner as taxes, and any
      reference in this chapter to tax or tax imposed by this  chapter,  shall
      be  deemed  also to refer to the additions to tax and penalties provided
      by this section. For purposes of section  11-1923  of  this  subchapter,
      this subdivision shall not apply to:
        (1)  any  addition  to  tax  under  subdivision  (a) except as to that
      portion attributable to a deficiency;
        (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c); and
        (3) any additional penalty under subdivision (i).
        (k) Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b)  and
      (e),  the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his or her return
      shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the  deficiency
      only  if  such return was filed on or before the last day prescribed for
      the filing of such return, determined with regard to  any  extension  of
      time for such filing.
        (l) Person defined. For purposes of subdivisions (g) and (i), the term
      "person"  includes  an  individual,  corporation  or  partnership  or an
      officer  or  employee  of  any  corporation   (including   a   dissolved
      corporation),  or  a  member or employee of any partnership, who as such
      officer, employee, or member is under a  duty  to  perform  the  act  in
      respect of which the violation occurs.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1928
---------------

Section 11-1928 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1928  Overpayment.  (a)  General.  The  commissioner, within the
      applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment of  tax  and
      interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any tax
      imposed  by this chapter or by another chapter or chapters of this title
      on the person who  made  the  overpayment,  and  the  balance  shall  be
      refunded.  Any  refund  under  this  section shall be made only upon the
      filing of a return.
        (b) Excessive withholding. If the amount allowable as a credit for tax
      withheld from the taxpayer exceeds his or her tax to  which  the  credit
      relates, the excess shall be considered an overpayment.
        (c)  Overpayment  by employer. If there has been an overpayment of tax
      required to be deducted and  withheld  under  section  11-1908  of  this
      chapter,  refund  shall  be made to the employer only to the extent that
      the amount of the overpayment was  not  deducted  and  withheld  by  the
      employer.
        (d)  Credits  against  estimated  tax.  The commissioner may prescribe
      regulations providing for the crediting against the  estimated  tax  for
      any  taxable  year  of the amount determined to be an overpayment of the
      tax for a preceding taxable year.  If  any  overpayment  of  tax  is  so
      claimed  as  a  credit  against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable
      year, such amount shall be considered as a payment of the  tax  for  the
      succeeding  taxable  year  (whether  or  not  claimed as a credit in the
      declaration of estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year),  and  no
      claim  for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for the
      taxable year for which the overpayment arises.
        (e) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax  liability  for  a
      period  in  respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such amount shall
      be considered an overpayment.
        (f) Assessment and collection after limitation period. If  any  amount
      of  tax  is  assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of
      limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered
      an overpayment.
        (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law in article fifty-two  of  the
      civil  practice  law  and  rules to the contrary, the procedures for the
      enforcement of money judgments shall not  apply  to  the  department  of
      finance,  or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, as
      a garnishee, with respect to any amount  of  money  to  be  refunded  or
      credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1929
---------------

Section 11-1929 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1929  Limitations  on  credit  or refund. (a) General. Claim for
      credit or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer
      within three years from the time the return was filed or two years  from
      the  time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later,
      or if no return was filed, within two years from the time  the  tax  was
      paid.  If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of
      the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within
      the  three  years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the
      period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the  claim  is
      not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year
      period,  the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion
      of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of
      the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim  is
      filed,  the  amount  of  a  credit or refund shall not exceed the amount
      which would be allowable if a claim had  been  filed  on  the  date  the
      credit or refund is allowed.
        (b)  Extension  of  time  by  agreement.  If  an  agreement  under the
      provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b)  of  section  11-1925  of
      this  subchapter  (extending  the  period for assessment of tax) is made
      within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for  the
      filing  of  a  claim for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim
      for credit or refund, or for making credit or  refund  if  no  claim  is
      filed,  shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the
      period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the  agreement
      or  any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not
      exceed the portion of the tax paid after the execution of the  agreement
      and  before  the  filing  of  the  claim  or the making of the credit or
      refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within  the
      period  which  would  be applicable under subdivision (a) if a claim had
      been filed on the date the agreement was executed.
        (c) Notice of change or  correction  of  federal  or  New  York  state
      income.  If a taxpayer is required by section 11-1922 of this chapter to
      report  a  change  or  correction  in  federal or New York state taxable
      income or self-employment income reported on his or her federal  or  New
      York  state  tax  return,  or  to  report  an  assessment or a change or
      correction which is treated  in  the  same  manner  as  if  it  were  an
      overpayment  for  federal  or  New York state income tax purposes, or to
      file an amended return with the commissioner, claim for credit or refund
      of any resulting overpayment of tax  shall  be  filed  by  the  taxpayer
      within  two  years from the time the notice of such change or correction
      or such amended return was required to be filed with  the  commissioner.
      If  the  report  or  amended  return required by section 11-1922 of this
      chapter is not filed within the ninety  day  period  therein  specified,
      interest  on  any resulting refund or credit shall cease to accrue after
      such ninetieth day. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed
      the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal  or  New
      York state change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer's amended
      federal or New York state income tax or self-employment tax return. This
      subdivision  shall  not  affect  the time within which or the amount for
      which a claim for  credit  or  refund  may  be  filed  apart  from  this
      subdivision.
        (d)  Failure  to  file  claim  within  prescribed period. No credit or
      refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in  subdivision  (e)
      of this section or subdivision (d) of section 11-1932 of this subchapter
      after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in
      this  chapter  unless  a  claim  for  credit  or  refund is filed by the
      taxpayer within such period. Any later credit  shall  be  void  and  any
      later  refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other
    
      law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in  respect
      of taxes under this chapter.
        (e)  Effect of petition to commissioner. If a notice of deficiency for
      a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 11-1923  of
      this  subchapter  and  if  the taxpayer files a timely petition with the
      commissioner under section 11-1931 of this subchapter, the  commissioner
      may  determine  that  the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year
      (whether or not the commissioner also determines a deficiency  for  such
      year).  No  separate  claim  for credit or refund for such year shall be
      filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be allowed  or  made,
      except:
        (1)  as  to  overpayments determined by a decision of the commissioner
      which has become final;
        (2) as to any amount collected in excess  of  an  amount  computed  in
      accordance with the decision of the commissioner which has become final;
        (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the
      making of levy for collection has expired; and
        (4)  as  to  any  amount claimed as a result of a change or correction
      described in subdivision (c) of this section.
        (f) Limit on amount of credit or refund.  The  amount  of  overpayment
      determined  under  subdivision  (e)  of  this  section  shall,  when the
      decision of the commissioner has become final, be credited  or  refunded
      in accordance with subdivision (a) of section 11-1928 of this subchapter
      and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the commissioner determines
      as part of his or her decision was paid:
        (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
        (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a),
      (b)  or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice
      of deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating  the
      grounds upon which the commissioner finds that there is an overpayment.
        (g)  Early  return.  For  purposes  of  this section, any return filed
      before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  the  filing  thereof  shall  be
      considered  as  filed on such last day, determined without regard to any
      extension of time granted the taxpayer.
        (h) Prepaid tax. For purposes of this section, any  tax  paid  by  the
      taxpayer  before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  its  payment, any tax
      withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount paid
      by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be  deemed  to
      have  been paid by the taxpayer on the fifteenth day of the fourth month
      following the close of his or her taxable year  with  respect  to  which
      such amount constitutes a credit or payment.
        (i) Return and payment of withholding tax. Notwithstanding subdivision
      (g)  of  this  section, for purposes of this section with respect to any
      withholding tax:
        (1) if a return for any period ending with or within a  calendar  year
      is  filed  before  April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such
      return shall be considered filed on April fifteenth of  such  succeeding
      calendar year; and
        (2)  if  a  tax  with  respect  to remuneration paid during any period
      ending with or within a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth  of
      the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April
      fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.
        (j)  Cross  reference.  For  provision  barring  refund of overpayment
      credited against tax of  a  succeeding  year,  see  subdivision  (d)  of
      section 11-1928 of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1930
---------------

Section 11-1930 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1930  Interest  on overpayment. (a) General. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of section three-a of the  general  municipal  law,  interest
      shall be allowed and paid as follows at the appropriate rates prescribed
      for  overpayments  of tax under chapter seventeen of this title upon any
      overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:
        (1) from the date of the overpayment to the  due  date  of  an  amount
      against which a credit is taken; or
        (2)  from  the  date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by
      the commissioner) preceding the date of a refund check by not more  than
      thirty  days,  whether  or  not  such  refund  check  is accepted by the
      taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The  acceptance  of
      such  check  shall  be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to
      claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.
        No interest shall be allowed or paid if the  amount  thereof  is  less
      than one dollar.
        (b)  Advance  payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for
      tax withholding. The provisions of subdivisions  (g),  (h)  and  (i)  of
      section 11-1929 of this subchapter applicable in determining the date of
      payment  of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitations on
      credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment
      for purposes of this section.
        (c) Refund within three months of due date of tax. If any  overpayment
      of tax imposed by this chapter is refunded within three months after the
      last  date prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for filing the
      return of such tax or within three months after the  return  was  filed,
      whichever  is  later, no interest shall be allowed under this section on
      such overpayment.
        (d) Cross-reference. For provision terminating interest after  failure
      to file notice of federal or New York state change under section 11-1922
      of this chapter, see subdivision (c) of 11-1929 of this subchapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1931
---------------

Section 11-1931 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1931  Petition  to  commissioner.  (a)  General.  The  form of a
      petition  to  the  commissioner,  and  further  proceedings  before  the
      commissioner in any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be
      governed  by such rules as the commissioner shall prescribe. No petition
      shall be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a hearing on
      reasonable  prior  notice.  Such  hearing  shall  be  conducted  by  the
      commissioner,  or by a hearing officer designated by the commissioner to
      take evidence and report to the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  shall
      decide  the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision shall
      be mailed promptly to the taxpayer by certified or  registered  mail  at
      his  or  her  last  known  address  and  such notice shall set forth the
      commissioner's findings of fact and a brief statement of the grounds  of
      decision  in  each  case  decided  in  whole or in part adversely to the
      taxpayer. Any portion of an assessment of a deficiency disallowed by the
      commissioner's decision, shall be forthwith abated, or if paid, credited
      or refunded to the taxpayer without the making of a claim therefor.
        (b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety  days,
      or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside
      of  the  United  States,  after  the mailing of the notice of deficiency
      authorized by section 11-1923 of this subchapter, the taxpayer may  file
      a   petition   with  the  commissioner  for  a  redetermination  of  the
      deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim  for  refund  for  the
      same  taxable  year  or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision
      (f) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter.
        (c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer  may  file  a  petition  with  the
      commissioner for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:
        (1)  the  taxpayer  has  filed  a  timely  claim  for  refund with the
      commissioner,
        (2) the taxpayer has not previously  filed  with  the  commissioner  a
      timely  petition  under  subdivision  (b)  of  this section for the same
      taxable year unless the petition under this  subdivision  relates  to  a
      separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (e)
      of section 11-1929 of this subchapter, and
        (3)  either: (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or
      (B) the commissioner has  mailed  to  the  taxpayer,  by  registered  or
      certified  mail,  a  notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in
      part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed  more  than  two
      years  after  the  date  of  mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless
      prior to the expiration of such a two-year period it has  been  extended
      by  written  agreement  between  the taxpayer and the commissioner. If a
      taxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that  he  or  she  be
      mailed  a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this
      subdivision for filing a petition for refund shall  begin  on  the  date
      such waiver is filed.
        (d) Assertion and assessment of deficiency after filing petition.
        (1)  Petition  for  redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files
      with the commissioner a petition for redetermination  of  a  deficiency,
      the  commissioner  shall  have  power  to determine and assess a greater
      deficiency than asserted in the notice of deficiency  and  to  determine
      and assess any addition to tax or penalty provided in section 11-1927 of
      this  subchapter, if claim therefor is asserted at or before the hearing
      and within the period in which  an  assessment  would  be  timely  under
      section 11-1925 of this subchapter under the rules of the commissioner.
        (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with the commissioner a
      petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the commissioner may:
        (A)  determine  and assess a deficiency for such year as to any amount
      of deficiency claim (which shall be an assessment) for which is asserted
      at or before the hearing under rules of the commissioner, and within the
    
      period in which an assessment would be timely under section  11-1925  of
      this subchapter, or
        (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in
      the  petition,  as  is  offset  by  other  issues pertaining to the same
      taxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules  of
      the commissioner.
        (3)  Opportunity  to  respond.  A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable
      opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the commissioner under
      this subdivision.
        (4) Restriction on further notices  of  deficiency.  If  the  taxpayer
      files  a petition with the commissioner under this section, no notice of
      deficiency under section 11-1923 of this subchapter  may  thereafter  be
      issued  by the commissioner for the same taxable year, except in case of
      fraud or with respect to a change or correction in federal or  New  York
      state  taxable  income or self-employment income required to be reported
      under section 11-1922 of this chapter.
        (e) Burden of proof. In any case before the  commissioner  under  this
      chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the
      following  issues,  as  to  which  the burden of proof shall be upon the
      commissioner:
        (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of  fraud  with  intent  to
      evade tax;
        (2)  whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of
      a taxpayer (except where the petitioner's liability arises by reason  of
      section  11-1936  of this subchapter), but not to show that the taxpayer
      was liable for the tax; and
        (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a  deficiency
      where  such  increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency
      was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase
      in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of federal or  New
      York  state  taxable  income  or  self-employment  income required to be
      reported under section 11-1922 of this chapter, and of which  change  or
      correction  the  commissioner had no notice at the time he or she mailed
      the notice of deficiency.
        (f) Evidence of related federal determination. Evidence of  a  federal
      determination   relating   to   issues  raised  in  a  case  before  the
      commissioner  under  this  section  shall  be  admissible,  under  rules
      established by the commissioner.
        (g)  Jurisdiction  over  other  years. The commissioner shall consider
      such facts with relation  to  the  taxes  for  other  years  as  may  be
      necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so
      doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for
      any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1932
---------------

Section 11-1932 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1932  Review of commissioner's decision. (a) General. A decision
      of the commissioner shall be  subject  to  judicial  review  for  error,
      illegality  or  unconstitutionality  at  the  instance  of  any taxpayer
      affected thereby in the manner provided by law for the review of a final
      decision  or  action  of  administrative  agencies  of  the   city.   An
      application  by  a  taxpayer  for  such  review must be made within four
      months after notice of the decision is sent by certified  or  registered
      mail to the taxpayer.
        (b)  Judicial  review  exclusive  remedy  of taxpayer. The review of a
      decision of the commissioner provided by this section shall be exclusive
      remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial determination  of  the
      liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this chapter.
        (c)  Collection  pending  review;  review  bond.  Irrespective  of any
      restrictions on the collection  of  assessments  for  deficiencies,  the
      commissioner  may  collect  by  levy  or,  otherwise any assessment of a
      deficiency after the expiration of the period specified  in  subdivision
      (a)  of  this section, nothwithstanding that an application for judicial
      review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer,
      unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his or  her  application  for
      review is made, has paid the assessed deficiency, has deposited with the
      commissioner  the  amount  of the assessed deficiency, or has filed with
      the commissioner a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under  subdivision
      (h)  of section 11-1937 of this subchapter) in the amount of the portion
      of the assessed deficiency (including interest  and  other  amounts)  in
      respect of which the application for review is made with surety approved
      by  a justice of the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned
      upon the payment of the  assessed  deficiency  (including  interest  and
      other  amounts) as finally determined. If as a result of a waiver of the
      restrictions on the collection of a deficiency any part  of  the  amount
      determined  by  the  commissioner is paid after the filing of the review
      bond,  such  bond  shall,  at  the   request   of   the   taxpayer,   be
      proportionately  reduced. A similar bond for all costs and charges which
      may accrue against the taxpayer in  the  prosecution  of  such  judicial
      review  proceeding  must  be filed with the commissioner before any such
      proceeding is instituted.
        (d) Credit, refund or abatement after  review.  If  the  amount  of  a
      deficiency  assessed and determined by the commissioner is disallowed in
      whole or in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed  shall
      be  credited  or  refunded  to the taxpayer, without the making of claim
      therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
        (e) Date of finality of commissioner's decision.  A  decision  of  the
      commissioner  shall  become  final  upon  the  expiration  of the period
      specified in subdivision (a) of this section for making  an  application
      for  review, if no such application has been duly made within such time,
      or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration of  the  time
      for   all  further  judicial  review,  or  upon  the  rendering  by  the
      commissioner of a decision in accordance with the mandate of  the  court
      on  review.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an
      application for review, the decision of the commissioner shall be deemed
      final on the date the  notice  of  decision  is  sent  by  certified  or
      registered mail to the taxpayer.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1933
---------------

Section 11-1933 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1933  Mailing rules; holidays. (a) Timely mailing. If any claim,
      statement, notice, petition, or other document (including to the  extent
      authorized  by  the  commissioner,  a return or declaration of estimated
      tax) required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or  before  a
      prescribed  date  under  authority  of any provision of this chapter is,
      after such period or such date, delivered by the United States  mail  to
      the  commissioner,  bureau, office, officer or person with which or with
      whom such document is required to be  filed,  the  date  of  the  United
      States  postmark  stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date
      of delivery. This subdivision shall apply  only  if  the  postmark  date
      falls  within  the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date
      for the filing of such document, determined with regard to any extension
      granted for such filing, and only if such document was deposited in  the
      mail,  postage  prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner, bureau,
      office, officer or person with  which  or  with  whom  the  document  is
      required  to  be  filed.  If  any  document  is  sent  by  United States
      registered mail, such registration shall be prima  facie  evidence  that
      such document was delivered to the commissioner, bureau, office, officer
      or  person  to  which  or  to  whom  addressed.  To  the extent that the
      commissioner shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may  be  used
      in  lieu  of  registered mail under this section. This subdivision shall
      apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States post office
      only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the commissioner.
        (b) Last known address. For purposes of  this  chapter,  a  taxpayer's
      last  known  address shall be the address given in the last return filed
      by the taxpayer, unless subsequent to the  filing  of  such  return  the
      taxpayer shall have notified the commissioner of a change of address.
        (c)  Last  day  a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the last day
      prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any  extension  of
      time)  for  performing  any  act  falls  on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal
      holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act  shall  be
      considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is
      not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1934
---------------

Section 11-1934 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1934  Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The
      taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected  by  the  commissioner,
      and  he  or she may establish the mode or time for the collection of any
      amount  due  the  commissioner  under  this  chapter  if  not  otherwise
      specified.  The commissioner shall, upon request, give a receipt for any
      sum collected under this chapter. The commissioner may  authorize  banks
      or  trust  companies  which  are depositories or financial agents of the
      city to receive and give a  receipt  for  any  tax  imposed  under  this
      chapter  in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the
      commissioner may prescribe; and the  commissioner  shall  prescribe  the
      manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such
      banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the
      commissioner.
        (b)  Notice  and  demand  for  tax.  The commissioner shall as soon as
      practicable and, in the case of an assessment the collection of which is
      restricted by the provisions of subdivision (c) of  section  11-1923  of
      this  subchapter,  as  soon  as practicable after the expiration of such
      restrictions give notice to each person liable for any  amount  of  tax,
      addition  to  tax,  penalty  or  interest,  which  has been assessed but
      remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment  thereof.  Such
      notice  shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such
      person or shall be sent by mail to such  person's  last  known  address.
      Except  where  the  commissioner  determines  that  collection  would be
      jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed  prior  to  the  last  date
      (including  any  date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such
      tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.
        (c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person  liable
      under  this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty
      or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within  ten  days  after
      notice and demand therefor is given to such person under subdivision (b)
      of this section, the commissioner may within six years after the date of
      the  expiration  of  the period of restriction on the collection of such
      assessment issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of  the
      state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance of the
      city,  commanding  the  sheriff or such officer or employee to levy upon
      and sell such person's real and personal property for the payment of the
      amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant, and  to  return
      such  warrant  to  the  commissioner  and  pay  to  him or her the money
      collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt  of  the
      warrant.  If  the commissioner finds that the collection of tax or other
      amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment  of  such
      tax  may  be made by the commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay
      such tax or other amount the commissioner may issue  a  warrant  without
      regard to the ten-day period provided in this subdivision.
        (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or
      officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this
      section  shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of
      the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the  judgment
      docket,  in  the  column  for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer
      mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the  tax  or  other
      amounts  for  which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is
      filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the  real,
      personal and other property of the taxpayer.
        (e)  Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the
      commissioner shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed  to  have  obtained
      judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.
        (f)  Execution.  The  sheriff  or  officer or employee shall thereupon
      proceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in  the
    
      same  manner  prescribed  by law in respect to executions issued against
      property upon judgments of a court of record, and  a  sheriff  shall  be
      entitled  to  the same fees for such sheriff's services in executing the
      warrant,  to  be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of
      the department of finance of the city  may  proceed  in  any  county  or
      counties  of  this  state  and  shall  have  all the powers of execution
      conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall  be  entitled  to  no  fee  or
      compensation  in  excess  of actual expenses paid in connection with the
      execution of the warrant.
        (g) Taxpayer not then a resident. Where  a  notice  and  demand  under
      subdivision  (b)  shall  have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a
      resident of this state, and it appears to the commissioner  that  it  is
      not  practicable  to  find  in  this  state  property  of  the  taxpayer
      sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or  other  amount  owing  by
      such taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, the commissioner
      may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant
      directed  to  an officer or employee of the department of finance of the
      city a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or  registered
      mail  to  the  taxpayer at his or her last known address, subject to the
      rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section 11-1933 of this
      subchapter. Such warrant  shall  command  the  officer  or  employee  to
      proceed  in  the  city,  and such officer or employee shall, within five
      days after receipt of  the  warrant,  file  the  warrant  and  obtain  a
      judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the commissioner may
      authorize  the  institution  of  any  action or proceeding to collect or
      enforce the judgment in any place and by  any  procedure  where  and  by
      which  a  civil  judgment  of the supreme court of the state of New York
      could be collected or enforced. The commissioner may also, in his or her
      discretion, designate agents  or  retain  counsel  for  the  purpose  of
      collecting,  outside  the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions
      to tax, penalties or  interest  which  have  been  assessed  under  this
      chapter  against taxpayers who are not then residents of this state, may
      fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of  money
      appropriated  or  otherwise  lawfully available for payment thereof, and
      may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance
      of their duties, in such form and in such  amount  as  the  commissioner
      shall deem proper and sufficient.
        (h) Action by the city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by
      the  corporation counsel or other appropriate officer of the city at the
      insistance of the commissioner to  recover  the  amount  of  any  unpaid
      taxes,  additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed
      under this chapter within six years prior to  the  date  the  action  is
      commenced.  The  period  during  which  collection  of any assessment is
      prohibited by subdivision (c) of section  11-1923  of  this  subchapter,
      shall be added to such six years.
        (i)  Release  of  lien.  The commissioner, if he or she finds that the
      interest of the city will not thereby  be  jeopardized,  and  upon  such
      conditions as may require, may release any property from the lien of any
      warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed
      pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the office
      of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1935
---------------

Section 11-1935 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1935  Transferees.  (a)  General.  The  liability,  at law or in
      equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions
      to tax, penalty or interest due to the city under this chapter, shall be
      assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same
      provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax to which  liability
      relates,  except  that  the period of limitations for assessment against
      the transferee shall  be  extended  by  one  year  for  each  successive
      transfer,  in  order,  from  the  original  taxpayer  to  the transferee
      involved, but not by more than three years in the  aggregate.  The  term
      "transferee" includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee; and
      also  includes  a  person liable for the amount of any tax, additions to
      tax, penalty or interest under the provisions of section 11-1936 of this
      subchapter.
        (b) Exceptions.  (1)  If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of
      limitations  for  assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has
      been filed by  the  commissioner  in  any  court  against  the  original
      taxpayer  or  the  last preceding transferee based upon the liability of
      the original taxpayer, then the period of limitation for  assessment  of
      liability  of  the transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year
      after such claim has  been  finally  allowed,  disallowed  or  otherwise
      disposed of.
        (2)  If,  before  the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision
      (a) of this section  or  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  for  the
      assessment  of  the  liability, the commissioner and the transferee have
      both consented in  writing  to  its  assessment  after  such  time,  the
      liability  may  be  assessed  at any time prior to the expiration of the
      period agreed upon. The  period  so  agreed  upon  may  be  extended  by
      subsequent  agreements  in  writing  made  before  the expiration of the
      period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period
      of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of  overpayments  of
      tax  made  by  such  transferee  or  overpayments  of  tax  made  by the
      transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to  credit  or
      refund,  such  agreement  and  any  extension thereof shall be deemed an
      agreement and extension  thereof  referred  to  in  subdivision  (b)  of
      section  11-1929  of this subchapter. If the agreement is executed after
      the expiration of the period of limitation for  assessment  against  the
      original  taxpayer,  then  in applying the limitations under subdivision
      (b) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter on the amount of the credit or
      refund, the periods specified in subdivision (a) of section  11-1929  of
      this  subchapter  shall be increased by the period from the date of such
      expiration to the date of the agreement.
        (c) Deceased transferor. If any person  is  deceased,  the  period  of
      limitation  for  assessment against such person shall be the period that
      would be in effect if he or she had lived.
        (d) Evidence. Notwithstanding the provisions  of  section  11-1942  of
      this  subchapter,  the  commissioner shall use his or her powers to make
      available to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the  transferee
      to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding
      transferees,  but  without  undue  hardship  to the original taxpayer or
      preceding transferee. See subdivision (e) of  section  11-1931  of  this
      subchapter for rule as to burden of proof.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1936
---------------

Section 11-1936 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1936  Liability  of  bulk  transferees. Whenever there is made a
      sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock
      of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining
      to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor,
      otherwise than in the ordinary  course  of  trade  and  in  the  regular
      prosecution  of  said  business,  the  purchaser, transferee or assignee
      shall at least ten days before taking possession  of  such  merchandise,
      fixtures,  or  merchandise  and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the
      commissioner by registered mail of the proposed sale and of  the  price,
      terms  and  conditions thereof, whether or not the seller, transferor or
      assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser,  transferee  or
      assignee,  that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, whether or not
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes  are
      owing, and whether or not any such taxes are in fact owing.
        Whenever  the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give the
      notice to the commissioner required by this  section,  or  whenever  the
      commissioner  shall  inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a
      possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property
      or choses in  action,  or  other  consideration,  which  the  purchaser,
      transferee  or  assignee  is  required  to  transfer over to the seller,
      transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first  priority  right  and
      lien  for  any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due
      from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the  purchaser,
      transferee   or  assignee  is  forbidden  to  transfer  to  the  seller,
      transferor or assignor any such sums of money,  property  or  choses  in
      action  to  the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to
      comply with the provisions of this subdivision the purchaser, transferee
      or assignee, in  addition  to  being  subject  to  the  liabilities  and
      remedies  imposed  under  the  provisions  of article six of the uniform
      commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the  city
      of any such taxes, theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the
      city  from  the seller, transferor or assignor and such liability may be
      assessed and enforced in the same manner as the  liability  for  tax  is
      imposed under this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1937
---------------

Section 11-1937 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1937  Jeopardy  determination  or  assessment. (a) Authority for
      making. If the commissioner believes that the assessment  or  collection
      of  a  deficiency  will  be  jeopardized  by  delay,  he  or  she shall,
      notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11-1923 and 11-1939  of  this
      subchapter, immediately assess and/or proceed to collect such deficiency
      (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for
      by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the commissioner for the
      payment thereof.
        (b)  Notice  of  deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made before
      any notice in respect of  the  tax  to  which  the  jeopardy  assessment
      relates  has  been mailed under section 11-1923 of this subchapter, then
      the commissioner shall mail a notice under  such  section  within  sixty
      days after making of the assessment.
        (c)  Amount  assessable  before decision of commissioner. The jeopardy
      assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or  less  than
      that  of  which  notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or not the
      taxpayer has therefor  filed  a  petition  with  the  commissioner.  The
      commissioner  may,  at  any  time  before rendering his or her decision,
      abate such assessment or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent  that
      he  or  she  believes  the  assessment  to  be  excessive in amount. The
      commissioner may in his or her decision redetermine the entire amount of
      the deficiency  and  of  all  amounts  assessed  at  the  same  time  in
      connection therewith.
        (d)  Amount assessable after decision of commissioner. If the jeopardy
      assessment of determination of jeopardy is made after  the  decision  of
      the  commissioner  is  rendered, such assessment or determination may be
      made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the commissioner in
      his or her decision.
        (e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy determination may not be
      made after the decision of the commissioner has become  final  or  after
      the  taxpayer  has made an application for review of the decision of the
      commissioner.
        (f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed  with
      the commissioner and when the amount which should have been assessed has
      been  determined  by  a  decision  of  the commissioner which has become
      final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been  stayed
      by  bond,  shall  be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand
      from the commissioner, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall
      be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined
      as the amount which should have been  assessed,  such  excess  shall  be
      credited  or  refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 11-1928 of
      this subchapter without the filing of  claim  therefor.  If  the  amount
      determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than
      the  amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and
      shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and  demand  from  the
      commissioner.
        (g)  Abatement  if jeopardy does not exist. The commissioner may abate
      the jeopardy determination if he or she finds  that  jeopardy  does  not
      exist.    Such  abatement  may  not  be  made  after  a  decision of the
      commissioner in respect of the deficiency has been rendered  or,  if  no
      petition  is  filed  with  the commissioner, after the expiration of the
      period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the  making
      of  a levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency,
      shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated has not been
      made, except that the running of such  period  shall  in  any  event  be
      suspended  for  the  period from the date of such jeopardy determination
      until the expiration of the tenth  day  after  the  day  on  which  such
      jeopardy determination is abated.
    
        (h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount
      of  any  assessment determined to be in jeopardy may be stayed by filing
      with the commissioner, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a
      bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the  stay  is  desired
      conditioned  upon  the  payment  of  the  amount (together with interest
      thereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for
      the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would  be  due.  Upon
      the filing of the bond, the collection of so much of the amount assessed
      as  is  covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the
      right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part
      of the amount covered by the bond and, if as a result of such waiver any
      part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall,  at
      the  request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion
      of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under
      section 11-1923 of this subchapter is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser
      amount,  the  bond  shall,  at  the  request   of   the   taxpayer,   be
      proportionately reduced.
        (i) Petition to commissioner. If the bond is given before the taxpayer
      has  filed his or her petition under section 11-1931 of this subchapter,
      the bond shall contain a further condition that if  a  petition  is  not
      filed  within  the period provided in such section, then the amount, the
      collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid  on  notice  and
      demand  at  any  time after the expiration of such period, together with
      interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to  the
      date  of  notice  and  demand  under this subdivision. The bond shall be
      conditioned upon the payment of so much of such  assessment  (collection
      of  which  is  stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the
      commissioner which has become final. If the commissioner determines that
      the amount assessed is greater than the amount which  should  have  been
      assessed,  then  the  bond  shall,  at  the  request of the taxpayer, be
      proportionately  reduced  when  the  decision  of  the  commissioner  is
      rendered.
        (j)  Stay  of sale of seized property pending commissioner's decision.
      Where a jeopardy assessment or a determination of jeopardy is made,  the
      property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold:
        (1)  if  subdivision  (b)  of this section is applicable, prior to the
      issuance of the notice of deficiency and  the  expiration  of  the  time
      provided  in  section  11-1931  of this subchapter for filing a petition
      with the commissioner, and
        (2) if a petition is filed with the commissioner  (whether  before  or
      after the making of such jeopardy assessment or determination), prior to
      the  expiration  of  the  period  during  which  the  collection  of the
      deficiency assessed would be  prohibited  if  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section were not applicable.
        Such  property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if
      the commissioner  determines  that  the  expenses  of  conservation  and
      maintenance  will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is
      perishable.
        (k) Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-1926 of
      this  subchapter,  the  last  date  prescribed  for  payment  shall   be
      determined  without  regard  to any notice and demand for payment issued
      under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for  such
      payment.
        (l)  Early termination of taxable year. If the commissioner finds that
      a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove his or
      her property therefrom, or to conceal himself or herself or his  or  her
      property  therein,  or  to  do  any other act tending to prejudice or to
      render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the  tax  for
    
      the  current  or  the  preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be
      brought without delay, the commissioner shall declare the taxable period
      for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such
      finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer, together with a demand
      for  immediate  payment  of  the  tax for the taxable period so declared
      terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so  much  of
      such  tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law
      for filing return and paying the tax has expired; and such  taxes  shall
      thereupon  become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding brought
      to enforce payment of taxes made  due  and  payable  by  virtue  of  the
      provisions  of this subdivision, the finding of the commissioner made as
      herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall
      be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.
        (m) Reopening of taxable period. Notwithstanding  the  termination  of
      the  taxable  period  of the taxpayer by the commissioner as provided in
      subdivision (1), the commissioner may reopen such  taxable  period  each
      time the taxpayer is found by the commissioner to have received wages or
      net  earnings  from  self-employment,  within  the current taxable year,
      since the termination of such period. A taxable period so terminated  by
      the commissioner may be reopened by the taxpayer if he or she files with
      the  commissioner  a  true  and accurate return of taxable wages and net
      earnings from  self-employment  under  this  chapter  for  such  taxable
      period,  together with such other information as the commissioner may by
      regulation prescribe.
        (n)  Furnishing  of  bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed   by   the
      commissioner.  Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings
      under  the  provisions of subdivision (1) prior to the expiration of the
      time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer  furnishes,
      under  regulations  prescribed by the commissioner, a bond to insure the
      timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes  or
      any taxes for prior years.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1938
---------------

Section 11-1938 ::    
        
     
        §   11-1938   Criminal  penalties.  (a)  Attempt  to  evade  tax.  Any
      individual, corporation or partnership or any officer or employee of any
      corporation, or member or employee of any partnership, who, with  intent
      to  evade  any  tax  or  any  requirement  of this chapter or any lawful
      requirement of the commissioner thereunder, shall fail to pay  the  tax,
      or  to  make,  render,  sign  or  certify  any  return or declaration of
      estimated tax, or to supply any information within the time required  by
      or under the provisions of this chapter, or who, with like intent, shall
      make,   render,   sign  or  certify  any  false  or  fraudulent  return,
      declaration or statement,  or  shall  supply  any  false  or  fraudulent
      information,  or  who  shall  fail  to  comply  with  the  provisions of
      subdivision (b) of section 11-1912 of this chapter after the service  of
      a   notice  by  the  commissioner  thereunder,  shall  be  guilty  of  a
      misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be  fined  not  to  exceed  five
      thousand  dollars  or  be imprisoned not to exceed one year, or both, at
      the discretion of the court.
        (b) Limitations. Notwithstanding the provisions of  section  30.10  of
      the  criminal  procedure  law  or  of  any  other  law  of this state, a
      prosecution for any offense under this section may be commenced  at  any
      time  not  later  than  three years after the commission of such offense
      provided that, if such offense is the failure to do an act  required  by
      or under any provision of this chapter to be done before a certain date,
      a  prosecution  for  such  offense may be commenced not later than three
      years after such date.
        (c) Willful  failure  to  withhold.  Any  individual,  corporation  or
      partnership  or  any officer or employee of any corporation (including a
      dissolved corporation), or member or employee of  any  partnership,  who
      willfully  fails to collect or pay over any withholding tax as required,
      shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be  guilty  of  a
      misdemeanor,  and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not to exceed
      five thousand dollars or imprisoned not to exceed one year, or both.
        (d) Two or more charges. In the prosecution  of  offenses  under  this
      section,  if  there  are  two  or  more  charges  against  any person or
      corporation, involving a violation or violations  of  any  provision  or
      provisions  of  this  chapter, whether for the same or different taxable
      years, instead  of  returning  several  indictments  or  filing  several
      informations,  all  of  such  charges may be joined in one indictment or
      information, in separate counts, and if  two  or  more  indictments  are
      found,  or  two or more informations are filed, the court may order them
      to be consolidated. If a person or corporation shall be convicted of two
      or more offenses constituting different crimes set  forth  in  different
      counts  of  one indictment or information, or in separate indictments or
      informations consolidated as hereinbefore provided, the court may impose
      a separate sentence for each offense, and if  imprisonment  is  imposed,
      the  court  may order any of such sentences to be served concurrently or
      consecutively.
        (e) Miscellaneous rules. Any prosecution under  this  section  may  be
      conducted  in  any  county  where the person or corporation to whose tax
      liability the proceeding relates resides, or has a place of business, or
      in any county in which any such  crime  is  committed.  The  corporation
      counsel of the city shall have concurrent jurisdiction with any district
      attorney  in  the  prosecution of any offense under this section. If the
      provisions of this section conflict with those contained  in  any  other
      law,  this section shall control. The certificate of the commissioner to
      the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return or declaration of
      estimated tax has not been filed,  or  that  information  has  not  been
      supplied,  as required by or under the provisions of this chapter, shall
      be prima facie evidence that such tax  has  not  been  paid,  that  such
    
      return  or  declaration has not been filed, or that such information has
      not been supplied. All fines levied under this section shall be paid  to
      the  commissioner and deposited in the same manner as revenues collected
      or received under this chapter.

Section 11-1939 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1939 Armed forces relief provisions. (a) Time to be disregarded.
      In the case of an individual serving in the armed forces of  the  United
      States or serving in support of such armed forces, in an area designated
      by  the  president  of the United States by executive order as a "combat
      zone" at any time during the  period  designated  by  the  president  by
      executive  order  as the period of combatant activities in such zone, or
      hospitalized outside the state as a  result  of  injury  received  while
      serving  in such an area during such time, the period of service in such
      area, plus the period  of  continuous  hospitalized  outside  the  state
      attributable  to  such  injury,  and  the  next  one hundred eighty days
      thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this  chapter  in
      respect  of  the  tax  liability  (including  any  interest, penalty, or
      addition to the tax) of such individual:
        (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed  within  the  time
      prescribed therefor:
        (A) filing any return of tax (except withholding tax);
        (B)  payment  of  any  tax (except withholding tax) or any installment
      thereof or of any  other  liability  to  the  commissioner,  in  respect
      thereof;
        (C)  filing  a  petition with the commissioner for credit or refund or
      for redetermination of a deficiency, or  application  for  review  of  a
      decision rendered by the commissioner;
        (D) allowance of a credit or refund of tax;
        (E) filing a claim for credit or refund of tax;
        (F)  giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of any tax,
      or with respect to any liability to the commissioner in respect of tax;
        (G) collection, by the commissioner,  by  levy  or  otherwise  of  the
      amount of any liability in respect of tax;
        (H)  bringing  suit  by  the  city,  or any officer, on its behalf, in
      respect of any liability in respect of tax; and
        (I) any  other  act  required  or  permitted  under  this  chapter  or
      specified  in  the  regulations  prescribed  under  this  section by the
      commissioner.
        (2) The amount of any credit or refund (including interest).
        (b) Action taken  before  ascertainment  of  right  to  benefits.  The
      collection of the tax imposed by this chapter or of any liability to the
      commissioner  in  respect of such tax, or any action or proceeding by or
      on behalf of the commissioner in  connection  therewith,  may  be  made,
      taken,  begun,  or  prosecuted in accordance with law, without regard to
      the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, unless prior to  such
      collection,  action,  or  proceeding  it  is ascertained that the person
      concerned is entitled to the benefit of subdivision (a).
        (c) Members of armed forces dying in action. In the case of any person
      who dies while in active service as a member of the armed forces of  the
      United  States,  if  such  death occurred while serving in a combat zone
      during a period of combatant activities in such zone,  as  described  in
      subdivision  (a)  of  this section, or as a result of wounds, disease or
      injury incurred while so serving, the tax imposed by this chapter  shall
      not  apply  with  respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of
      his or her death, or with respect to any prior taxable year ending on or
      after the first day so served in a combat zone, and no returns shall  be
      required  in  behalf  of such person or his or her estate for such year;
      and the tax for any such taxable year which is unpaid  at  the  date  of
      death, including interest, additions to tax and penalties, if any, shall
      not be assessed and, if assessed, the assessment shall be abated and, if
      collected,  shall be refunded to the legal representative of such estate
      if  one  has  been  appointed  and  has  qualified,  or,  if  no   legal
    
      representative  has  been  appointed  or has qualified, to the surviving
      spouse.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1940
---------------

Section 11-1940 ::    
        
     
        §   11-1940   General   powers   of  commissioner.  (a)  General.  The
      commissioner shall administer  and  enforce  the  tax  imposed  by  this
      chapter  and  the  commissioner  is  authorized  to  make such rules and
      regulations, and to require such facts and information to  be  reported,
      as the commissioner may deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this
      chapter  and  the  commissioner  may  delegate  his  or  her  powers and
      functions under all subchapters of this chapter to one  of  his  or  her
      deputies or to any employee or employees of his or her department.
        (b)  Examination  of  books  and  witnesses.  The commissioner for the
      purpose of ascertaining the  correctness  of  any  return,  or  for  the
      purpose  of  making  an  estimate of taxable wages and net earnings from
      self-employment of any person, shall have power to examine or  to  cause
      to  have  examined,  by any agent or representative designated by him or
      her for that purpose, any books, papers, records  or  memoranda  bearing
      upon  the matters required to be included in the return, and may require
      the attendance of the person rendering the  return  or  any  officer  or
      employee  of  such  person, or the attendance of any other person having
      knowledge in the premises, may take testimony and require proof material
      for the commissioner's information, with power to  administer  oaths  to
      such  person or persons and may issue commissions for the examination of
      witnesses who are out of the  state  or  unable  to  attend  before  the
      commissioner  or  excused  from  attendance,  and  for the production of
      books, papers, records or memoranda.
        (c) Abatement authority. The commissioner, of his or her  own  motion,
      may  abate  any  small  unpaid  balance  of an assessment of tax, or any
      liability in respect  thereof,  if  the  commissioner  determines  under
      uniform  rules  prescribed  by  him  or  her that the administration and
      collection costs involved would not warrant  collection  of  the  amount
      due.  The  commissioner  may  also  abate, of his or her own motion, the
      unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in  respect
      thereof,  which  is  excessive  in  amount,  or  is  assessed  after the
      expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable  thereto,  or
      is  erroneously or illegally assessed. No claim for abatement under this
      subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.
        (d) Special refund authority. Where no questions of fact  or  law  are
      involved  and  it  appears from the records of the commissioner that any
      moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or
      other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under  a  mistake
      of  facts,  pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner
      at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the
      power, upon making a record of his or her reasons therefor  in  writing,
      to cause such moneys so paid and being erroneously and illegally held to
      be refunded.
        (e)   Cooperation   with   the   United   States   and  other  states.
      Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-1942  of  this  subchapter,
      the  commissioner may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United
      States or such secretary's delegates, or the proper tax officer  of  any
      other  state  imposing  an income tax upon the income of individuals, or
      the authorized representative of either such  officer,  to  inspect  any
      return  filed  under this chapter, or may furnish to such officer or his
      or her authorized representative an  abstract  of  any  such  return  or
      supply  him  or her with information concerning an item contained in any
      such return, or disclosed by any investigation of  tax  liability  under
      this  chapter,  but such permission shall be granted or such information
      furnished to such officer or his or her representative only if the  laws
      of  the  United  States  or  of  such  state,  as the case may be, grant
      substantially  similar  privileges  to   the   commissioner   and   such
      information  is  to  be used for tax purposes only; and provided further
    
      the commissioner may furnish to the commissioner of internal revenue  or
      his  or  her  authorized  representative   such returns filed under this
      chapter and other tax information as he or she may consider  proper  for
      the use in court actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code,
      whether  civil  or  criminal,  where a written request therefor has been
      made to the commissioner by the secretary of the treasury of the  United
      States  or  by  his  or  her  delegates, provided the laws of the United
      States grant substantially  similar  powers  to  the  secretary  of  the
      treasury  of  the United States or such secretary's delegates. Where the
      commissioner has so authorized use of returns and other  information  in
      such actions or proceedings, officers and employees of the department of
      taxation  and  finance  may  testify  in  such actions or proceedings in
      respect to such returns or other information.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-1941
---------------

Section 11-1941 ::    
        
     
        § 11-1941 Joint enforcement. (1) If there is assessed a tax under this
      chapter  and  there  is  also  assessed  a tax or taxes against the same
      taxpayer pursuant to article twenty-two  of  the  tax  law  and  if  the
      commissioner  of  the tax imposed by this chapter takes action under the
      tax law with respect to the enforcement and collection  of  the  tax  or
      taxes  assessed  under  such  tax  law, the commissioner shall, wherever
      possible, accompany such action with  a  similar  action  under  similar
      enforcement and collection provisions of this chapter.
        (2)  Any  monies  collected  as a result of such joint action shall be
      deemed to  have  been  collected  in  proportion  in  the  amounts  due,
      including  tax,  penalties,  interest and additions to tax under article
      twenty-two of the tax law and under this chapter.
        (3) Whenever the commissioner takes  any  action  with  respect  to  a
      deficiency  of  personal income tax, under article twenty-two of the tax
      law other than the action set forth in subdivision one of  this  section
      the  commissioner  may,  in his or her discretion, accompany such action
      with a similar action under this chapter.

Section 11-1942 ::    
        
     
        §  11-1942  Secrecy requirement and penalties for violation. 1. Except
      in accordance with proper judicial order or  as  otherwise  provided  by
      law,  it  shall be unlawful for the commissioner or any other officer or
      employee of the department of finance of the city, any person engaged or
      retained by such commissioner or department on an  independent  contract
      basis,  any  depository to which any return may be delivered as provided
      in subdivision two of this section, any  officer  or  employee  of  such
      depository, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to
      inspect any report or return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion
      of  any  report  or  return  is  furnished,  or  to whom any information
      contained in any report or return is furnished, to divulge or make known
      in any manner the amount of wages or earnings  or  any  particulars  set
      forth  or disclosed in any report or return required under this chapter.
      The commissioner or any other officer  and  employee  charged  with  the
      custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any
      of  them  or  evidence  of  anything  contained in them in any action or
      proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city in  an  action  or
      proceeding  under  the provisions of this chapter or in any other action
      or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under  this  chapter
      to which the city is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to
      any  action  or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the
      reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly  involved  in  such
      action  or  proceeding, in any of which events the court may require the
      production of, and may admit in  evidence,  so  much  of  said  reports,
      returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or
      proceeding and no more; except as provided in subdivision (e) of section
      11-1940  of this subchapter. The commissioner may, nevertheless, publish
      a copy or a summary of any determination or decision rendered after  the
      hearing  required  under  section  11-1931  of  this  subchapter of this
      chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a
      taxpayer  or  the  taxpayers's  duly  authorized  representative  of   a
      certified  copy  of any return or report filed in connection with his or
      her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
      prevent the identification of particular  reports  or  returns  and  the
      items  thereof,  or  the  inspection by the legal representatives of the
      city of the report or return of any taxpayer who shall bring  action  to
      set  aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or
      proceeding under this chapter has been recommended by the  commissioner.
      Reports  and  returns  shall be preserved for three years and thereafter
      until the commissioner orders them to be destroyed. Any violation of the
      provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one
      thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both,  at
      the  discretion of the court, and if the offender be the commissioner or
      any other officer or employee of the city, he or she shall be  dismissed
      from office and be incapable of holding any public office in the city or
      the state for a period of five years thereafter.
        2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section,
      the commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion,  may  require  or
      permit  any  or  all  individuals, estates or trusts, liable for any tax
      imposed by this chapter, to make payments on account  of  estimated  tax
      and  payment  of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter to
      banks, banking houses or trust companies designated by the  commissioner
      of  finance  and  to  file declarations of estimated tax and reports and
      returns with such banks, banking houses or trust companies as agents  of
      the commissioner of finance, in lieu of making any such payment directly
      to  the  commissioner  of  finance. However, the commissioner of finance
      shall designate only such banks, banking houses or  trust  companies  as
      are depositories or financial agents of the city.
