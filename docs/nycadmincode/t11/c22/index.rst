      it   is   assessed,   within  ninety  days  after  the  giving  of  such
      determination, or, if the commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a
      conciliation  procedure  pursuant  to section 11-124 of the code and the
      taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation   conference   in   accordance
      therewith,  within  ninety  days  from  the  mailing  of  a conciliation
      decision  or  the  date  of  the  commissioner's  confirmation  of   the
      discontinuance  of  the  conciliation  proceeding,  both  (1)  serves  a
      petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  applies  to  the  tax
      appeals  tribunal  for  a  hearing  by  filing a petition, or unless the

      same. A hearing following a petition to the tax appeals tribunal and any
      appeal  to  the  tax  appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision
      rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to
      the requirements prescribed by the  tax  appeals  tribunal  pursuant  to
      sections  one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the
      charter. After such hearing by the commissioner of motor vehicles or the
      tax appeals tribunal, the commissioner of motor vehicles, if he  or  she
      holds  the  hearing,  or  the  tax  appeals  tribunal if the tax appeals
      tribunal holds the hearing, shall give notice of  the  determination  or
      decision  to the person against whom the tax is assessed and in the case
      of a tax appeals tribunal decision, to the commissioner of finance. Such
      determination by the commissioner of motor vehicles, or  a  decision  of
      the  tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error,
      illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason  whatsoever  by  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of
      the notice of such determination or tax  appeals  tribunal  decision.  A
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless (a) the amount of any
      tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if  any,
      shall  be  first  deposited  with the commissioner of motor vehicles and
      there shall  be  filed  with  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  an

      the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding
      be  dismissed  or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at
      the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the  commissioner
      of  motor  vehicles  may  be  in  a  sum  sufficient to cover the taxes,
    
      penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination or decision,
      plus  the  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  against  it  in  the

      commissioner   of  finance  denying  a  refund  or  credit  pursuant  to
      subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless  the
      applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing

      application for a revision of any tax, penalty  or  interest  complained
      of.  Such  hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through one

      commissioner of motor vehicles, in such amount and with such sureties as
      a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such
      proceeding  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all

        §  11-2211  Proceedings  to  recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall
      fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest  imposed  by  this  chapter  as
      herein  provided,  the  corporation  counsel,  upon  the  request of the
      commissioner of motor vehicles or of  the  commissioner  of  finance  if
      designated  as  his  or her agent, shall bring or cause to be brought an
      action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city  of  New
      York  in any court of the state of New York or of any other state of the
      United States.  However, if in his or her discretion the commissioner of
      motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as  his  or
      her  agent,  believes  that any such person subject to the provisions of
      this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state  or  remove  or
      dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be satisfied,
      and  that  any  such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she
      may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due  and  payable  and
      may issue a warrant immediately.
        b.  As  an  additional  or alternate remedy, the commissioner of motor
      vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated  as  his  or  her
      agent,  may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him
      or her to levy upon and sell the  real  and  personal  property  of  the
      person  liable  for  the tax which may be found within the city, for the
      payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and  interest,  and  the
      cost  of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the person
      who issued it and to pay to him or her the  money  collected  by  virtue
      thereof  within  sixty  days after the receipt of such warrant. The city
      sheriff shall within five days after the receipt  of  the  warrant  file
      with  the  county  clerk  a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall
      enter in the judgment docket the name of the  person  mentioned  in  the
      warrant  and  the  amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the
      warrant is issued and the date when such copy is  filed.  Thereupon  the
      amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to
      and  the  interest  in  real and personal property of the person against
      whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the
      warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as  that  provided  by
      law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a
      court  of  record and for services in executing the warrant such sheriff
      shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect  in  the
      same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of motor vehicles, or
      of  the  commissioner  of  finance  if designated as his or her agent, a
      warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an
      officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, and in the
      execution thereof such officer or employee shall  have  all  the  powers
      conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full,  the
      commissioner  of  motor  vehicles or the commissioner of finance, as the
      case may be, may from time to time issue new  warrants  and  shall  also
      have  the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if he or
      she had recovered judgment  therefor  and  execution  thereon  had  been
      returned unsatisfied.
        c.  The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the commissioner of finance may require, may release any  property  from
      the  lien  of  any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant for unpaid taxes,
      additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b
      of this section, and such release or vacating  of  the  warrant  may  be
      recorded  in  the  office of any recording officer in which such warrant
      has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the
      original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      pursuant  to  this  chapter,  or  of the receipt, document or other form
      issued pursuant to section 11-2204 of this chapter, or a duplicate  copy
      thereof;  nor  to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such

      United  States  of  America  or any department thereof, the state of New
      York or any department thereof, the city of New York or  any  department

      corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the
      district  attorney  of  any  county within the city; nor to prohibit the
      publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification

      contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  for
      administrative  review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the
      charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to  present  to
      the  tax  appeals tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any
      information contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material
      or relevant to the proceeding before the tax appeals tribunal.  The  tax
      appeals  tribunal  shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of

      required  under  the  provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing
      the same to the person for whom it is intended in  a  postpaid  envelope
      addressed  to  such person at the address given in the last return filed
      by him or her pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  chapter,  in  any
      application  made  by him or her, or in any application for registration
      made by him or her pursuant to section four hundred one of  the  vehicle
      and  traffic  law  or,  if no return has been filed or application made,
      then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing  of  such  notice
      shall  be  presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person
      to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined  according  to
      the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to
      run from the date of mailing of such notice.
        b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law
      relative  to  limitations  of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy
      shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the commissioner of
      motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as  his  or
      her   agent,  to  levy,  appraise,  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the
      collection of any tax or penalty  provided  by  this  chapter.  However,
      except  in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent
      to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall  be  made  after
      the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
      return;  provided,  however,  that  where  no  return  has been filed as
      provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
        c. Where, before the expiration of the period  prescribed  herein  for
      the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
      that  such  period be extended, the amount of such additional tax may be
      determined at any time  within  such  extended  period.  The  period  so
      extended  may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d. If any return, claim,  statement,  notice,  application,  or  other
      document  required  to  be  filed,  or  any payment required to be made,
      within a prescribed period or on  or  before  a  prescribed  date  under
      authority  of  any provision of this title is, after such period or such
      date, delivered by United States  mail  to  the  commissioner  of  motor
      vehicles,  commissioner  of  finance,  the tax appeals tribunal, bureau,
      office, officer or person with which  or  with  whom  such  document  is
      required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to
      be  made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope
      shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply
      only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period  or  on  or
      before  the  prescribed  date  for  the  filing of such document, or for
      making the payment, including any extension granted for such  filing  or
      payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail,
      postage  prepaid,  properly  addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  motor
      vehicles, commissioner of finance, the  tax  appeals  tribunal,  bureau,
      office,  officer  or  person  with  which  or  with whom the document is
      required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required  to
      be  made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such
      registration shall be  prima  facie  evidence  that  such  document  was
      delivered  to  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles,  commissioner  of
      finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person  to
      which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed
      the  postmark  date. The commissioner of motor vehicles is authorized to
      provide by  regulation  the  extent  to  which  the  provisions  of  the
      preceding  sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and
      the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. This subdivision  shall
      apply  in  the  case  of  postmarks not made by the United States Postal
    
      Service only if  and  to  the  extent  provided  by  regulation  of  the
      commissioner of motor vehicles.
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority  of  this title
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday  or  legal  holiday  in  the  state  of  New York, the
      performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on
      the next succeeding day  which  is  not  a  Saturday,  Sunday  or  legal
      holiday.
