=============================================

Section 11-662
--------------

Section 11-662 ::    
        
     
        §  11-662  Tax on transportation corporations and associations. 1. The
      term "corporation" as used in this subchapter shall include any business
      conducted by a trustee or trustees  wherein  interest  or  ownership  is
      evidenced by certificates or other written instruments.
        2. For the privilege of doing business or holding property in the city
      every  corporation,  joint-stock  company  or  association formed for or
      principally engaged in the conduct of aviation, steamboat, ferry (except
      a ferry company operating between any of the boroughs of the city  under
      a  lease  granted by the city), or navigation business, or formed for or
      principally engaged in the conduct of two or more  of  such  businesses,
      except  a  corporation,  joint-stock  company  or association subject to
      taxation under subchapter two of chapter eleven  of  this  title,  shall
      pay,  in  advance,  an  annual  tax to be computed upon the basis of the
      amount of its capital stock within the city during the  preceding  year,
      and upon each dollar of such amount.
        3.  The  measure of the amount of capital stock in the city, except as
      hereinafter provided, shall be such a  portion  of  the  issued  capital
      stock as the gross assets, exclusive of obligations issued by the United
      States  and cash on hand and on deposit, employed in any business within
      the city, bear to the gross assets, exclusive of obligations  issued  by
      the  United States and cash on hand and on deposit, wherever employed in
      business. Provided, however, that in the case of a  corporation  taxable
      hereunder  only for the privilege of holding property, the measure shall
      be such a portion of the issued  capital  stock  as  the  gross  assets,
      exclusive  of  obligations  issued by the United States and cash on hand
      and on deposit, located within the  city,  bear  to  the  gross  assets,
      exclusive  of  obligations  issued by the United States and cash on hand
      and on deposit, wherever located. The capital of a corporation  invested
      in the stock of another corporation shall be deemed to be assets located
      where  the  assets  of  the  issuing  corporation,  other  than patents,
      copyrights, trademarks, contracts and good will, are located.
        4. Every corporation, joint-stock company or  association  subject  to
      taxation  under  this  section  shall,  in  any event, pay annually, for
      taxable years  ending  on  or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-four,  a  minimum  tax of not less than ten dollars nor
      less than one mill, and for taxable years beginning on or after  January
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five,  a minimum tax of not less than
      fifteen dollars nor less than one and one-half mills, on each dollar  of
      such  a  portion of the net value of its issued capital stock, which net
      value for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to  be  not  less
      than five dollars per share, as may be determined upon such of the bases
      herein  provided  for the measurement thereof as is applicable. The term
      "net value" as used in this section shall be construed to mean not  less
      than  the difference between a corporation's assets and liabilities, and
      not less than the average price at which such stock sold during the year
      covered by the report which forms the basis for  the  tax.  But  if  the
      dividends  paid on the par value of any kind of capital stock during any
      year ending with the thirty-first day of December amounts to six or more
      than six per centum, the tax upon such kind of capital stock shall be at
      the rate of one-quarter of a mill for taxable years ending on or  before
      December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, and at the rate of
      four-tenths  of  a  mill for taxable years beginning on or after January
      first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-five  for  each  one  per  centum  of
      dividends  paid and shall be computed upon the par value of such capital
      stock, unless such a tax be  less  than  the  minimum  tax  hereinbefore
      provided in this section and the commissioner of finance shall, for such
      purpose,  make  a  fair and equitable apportionment of the assets of the
    
      the corporation, joint-stock company or association,  between  or  among
      the different kinds of stock.
        5.  If such corporation, joint-stock company or association shall have
      more than one kind of capital stock, and upon one of such kinds of stock
      a dividend or dividends amounting to six or more  than  six  per  centum
      upon  the  par  value  thereof,  has  been  paid,  and upon the other no
      dividend has been paid, or the dividend or dividends paid thereon amount
      to less than six per centum upon the par value  thereof,  then  the  tax
      shall be fixed upon each kind as hereinbefore provided.
        6. The dividend rate for a corporation having stock without nominal or
      par  value shall be determined by dividing the amount paid as a dividend
      or dividends during the year by the amount paid in on such stock and, if
      the rate is six per centum or more, then for taxable years ending on  or
      before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-four, the rate of
      one-quarter  of  a  mill  for  each one per centum of dividends shall be
      applied to the amount paid in on  such  stock,  and  for  taxable  years
      beginning  on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-five, the
      rate of four-tenths of a mill for each one per centum of dividends shall
      be applied to the amount paid in on such stock, unless such tax be  less
      than  the  minimum  tax  hereinbefore  in this section provided for. Any
      consideration given by a corporation for the purchase of its  own  stock
      in  excess  of the consideration received by it for the issuance of such
      stock shall for the  purposes  of  this  section,  be  considered  as  a
      dividend.
        7.  The  owning or holding in the city by any corporation of property,
      other than property exclusively in interstate or foreign commerce, shall
      constitute carrying on business within the city  within  the  intent  of
      this  section,  except that a corporation having no property in the city
      other than a bank balance or stocks or bonds, or one  or  more  of  such
      kinds of property, either held for safe keeping or pledged as collateral
      security  shall  not be taxable under this section, and further provided
      that any corporation having only office furniture or  fixtures,  a  bank
      balance,  and  stocks  or bonds pledged as collateral security or merely
      deposited for safe keeping, shall not be taxable under this section.
        8. The measure of the amount of  capital  stock  in  the  city  of  an
      aviation  corporation  shall  be  a  portion of the issued capital stock
      determined by applying thereto the arithmetical average of the following
      three ratios:  (a) the ratio which the aircraft arrivals and  departures
      within  the  city scheduled by any such corporation during the preceding
      calendar year bear to the total aircraft arrivals and departures  within
      and  without  the  city scheduled by it during the same period, provided
      that in the case of non-scheduled operations all arrivals and departures
      shall be substituted for scheduled  arrivals  and  departures;  (b)  the
      ratio  which  the  revenue  tons handled by such corporation at airports
      within the city during the preceding calendar year  bear  to  the  total
      revenue  tons  handled  by  it  at  airports within and without the city
      during the same period; and  (c)  the  ratio  which  such  corporation's
      originating  revenue  within  the  city for the preceding calendar years
      bears to its total originating revenue within and without the  city  for
      the  same  period.  As used in this section, the term "aircraft arrivals
      and departures" means the number of scheduled landings and  takeoffs  of
      the aircraft of an aviation corporation, and the number of scheduled air
      pickups  and  deliveries by the aircraft of such corporation, and in the
      case  of  non-scheduled  operations  shall  include  all  landings   and
      takeoffs,  pickups  and deliveries; the term "originating revenue" means
      revenue to any such  corporation  from  the  transportation  of  revenue
      passengers  and  revenue  property  first  received  by such corporation
      either as originating or connecting traffic at airports;  and  the  term
    
      "revenue  tons  handled" by any such corporation at an airport means the
      weight in  tons  of  revenue  passengers  (at  two  hundred  pounds  per
      passenger)  and  revenue  cargo  first received either as originating or
      connecting  traffic  or  finally  discharged by such corporation at such
      airport.
        9. The measure of the capital stock  in  the  city  of  a  corporation
      engaged  in  the  operation of vessels in foreign commerce shall be such
      portion of the issued capital stock as the aggregate number  of  working
      days  in territorial waters of the city of all such vessels bears to the
      aggregate number of working days of all such vessels. The dividend  rate
      for  such  a corporation shall be determined by dividing the amount paid
      as a dividend or dividends on all classes of stock during  the  year  by
      the  amount  of  paid-in  capital  and, if the rate is six per centum or
      more, then for taxable years ending on or before December  thirty-first,
      nineteen  hundred  seventy-four,  the  rate of one-quarter of a mill for
      each one per centum of dividends shall be applied to the amount of  such
      paid-in  capital,  and  for  taxable years beginning on or after January
      first, nineteen hundred seventy-five, the rate of four-tenths of a  mill
      for  each  one per centum of dividends shall be applied to the amount of
      such paid-in capital.

        §   11-663   Additional   tax   on   transportation  corporations  and
      associations.   Every corporation, joint-stock  company  or  association
      formed for or principally engaged in the conduct of aviation, steamboat,
      ferry  (except  a ferry company operating between any of the boroughs of
      the city under a lease granted by the city), or navigation  business  or
      formed  for or principally engaged in the conduct of two or more of such
      businesses, except a corporation,  joint-stock  company  or  association
      subject  to  taxation  under  subchapter  two  of chapter eleven of this
      title, shall pay for the privilege of carrying on its  business  in  the
      city,  a  tax  which shall be equal to five-tenths of one per centum for
      taxable years  ending  on  or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-four, and seventy-five hundredths of one per centum for
      taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-five  upon  its gross earnings from all sources within the city,

      wholly intra-city. Provided, however, gross earnings from transportation
      business both originating and terminating within the city and traversing
      both  the  city  and  any other city, any state or states or any country
      shall be subject to the tax imposed by this section  and  such  earnings
      shall be allocated to the city in the same ratio that the mileage within
      the city bears to the total mileage of such business.

      same extent as if the business were conducted by the agents or  officers
      of  such  corporation,  joint-stock  company or association. A dissolved

--------------

Section 11-665 ::    
        
     
        §  11-665  Service  of  process;  limitation of time. 1. Every foreign
      corporation (other than a moneyed corporation) subject to the provisions
      of this subchapter, except a corporation having authority to do business
      by virtue of section thirteen hundred five of the  business  corporation
      law,  shall file in the department of state a certificate of designation
      in its corporate name, signed  and  acknowledged  by  its  president  or
      vice-president  or its secretary or treasurer, under its corporate seal,
      designating the secretary of state as its agent upon whom process in any
      action provided for by  this  subchapter  or  subchapter  five  of  this
      chapter may be served within this state, and setting forth an address to
      which  the  secretary  of  state  shall  mail a copy of any such process
      against the corporation which may be served upon the secretary of state.
      In case any such corporation shall have failed to file such  certificate
      of  designation,  it shall be deemed to have designated the secretary of
      state as its agent upon whom such process against it may be served;  and
      until a certificate of designation shall have been filed the corporation
      shall  be  deemed to have directed the secretary of state to mail copies
      of process served upon the secretary of state to the corporation at  its
      last   known  office  address  within  or  without  the  state.  When  a
      certificate of designation  has  been  filed  by  such  corporation  the
      secretary  of  state shall mail copies of process thereafter served upon
      the secretary of state to the address set forth in such certificate. Any
      such corporation, from time to time, may change the address to which the
      secretary of state is directed to mail copies of process,  by  filing  a
      certificate  to  that  effect  executed, signed and acknowledged in like
      manner as a certificate of designation as herein  provided.  Service  of
      process  upon  any  such  corporation  or  upon  any  corporation having
      authority to do business by virtue of section thirteen hundred  five  of
      the  business  corporation  law,  in  any  action  commenced at any time
      pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter five or subchapter six  of
      this  chapter  may  be  made by either: (1) personally delivering to and
      leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of state or with
      any person authorized by the secretary of state to receive such  service
      duplicate copies thereof at the office of the department of state in the
      city  of  Albany,  in which event the secretary of state shall forthwith
      send by registered mail, return receipt requested, one of such copies to
      the corporation at the address designated by it or  at  its  last  known
      office address within or without the state, or (2) personally delivering
      to  and leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of state
      or with any person authorized by the secretary of state to receive  such
      service,  a copy thereof at the office of the department of state in the
      city of Albany and by delivering a copy hereof to, and leaving such copy
      with, the president,  vice-president,  secretary,  assistant  secretary,
      treasurer,  assistant  treasurer, or cashier of such corporation, or the
      officer performing corresponding functions  under  another  name,  or  a
      director  or  managing agent of such corporation, personally without the
      state. Proof of such personal service without the state shall  be  filed
      with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending within thirty
      days  after  such  service,  and such service shall be complete ten days
      after proof thereof is filed.
        2. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules relative to  the
      limitation  of  time  of enforcing a civil remedy shall not apply to any
      proceeding or action taken  to  levy,  appraise,  assess,  determine  or
      enforce  the  collection  of  any  tax  or  penalty  prescribed  by this
      subchapter or subchapter five of this chapter, provided,  however,  that
      as  to  real  estate  in the hands of persons who are owners thereof who
      would be purchasers in good faith but for such tax or penalty and as  to
      the  lien  on  real  estate  of  mortgages  held by persons who would be
    
      holders thereof in good faith but for such  tax  or  penalty,  all  such
      taxes  and  penalties  shall  cease  to be a lien on such real estate as
      against such purchasers or holders after the  expiration  of  ten  years
      from  the date such taxes become due and payable. The limitations herein
      provided for shall not apply to any transfer from  a  corporation  to  a
      person  or  corporation  with  intent  to avoid payment of any taxes, or
      where with like intent the transfer is made to a grantee corporation, or
      any subsequent grantee corporation controlled by such grantor  or  which
      has any community of interest with it, either through stock ownership or
      otherwise.

      under this subchapter shall report as follows:
        1. Every corporation, association or joint-stock company liable to pay
      a tax under section 11-662 of this subchapter shall, on or before  March
      first in each year, make a written report to the commissioner of finance
      of  its condition at the close of its business on the preceding December

      city during such year.
        2. Every corporation, joint-stock company or association liable to pay
      an additional tax under section 11-663 of this subchapter shall also, on
      or before  February  fifteenth,  May  fifteenth,  August  fifteenth  and
      November   fifteenth  in  each  year,  make  a  written  report  to  the
      commissioner of finance of the amount of its gross earnings  subject  to
      the  tax  imposed by said section for the quarter year ended on the last
      day of the second month preceding that in which the report  is  required
      to  be  filed.  Any such corporation, joint-stock company or association
      which ceases to be subject to the tax imposed by section 11-663 of  this
      subchapter   by   reason   of  a  liquidation,  dissolution,  merger  or
      consolidation with any other corporation, or any other cause, shall,  on

      finance  of  the amount of its gross earnings subject to the tax imposed
      by section 11-663 of this subchapter for any period for which no  report
      was therefor filed.
        3.  The  commissioner  of  finance may for good cause shown extend the
      time within  which  any  corporation  is  required  to  report  by  this
      subchapter.
        4. Every report required by this subchapter shall have annexed thereto
      a  certification  by the president, vice-president, treasurer, assistant
      treasurer, or chief accounting officer  or  any  other  officer  of  the
      corporation,  association  or  joint-stock company duly authorized so to
      act, or of the person or one of the  persons,  or  the  members  of  the
      partnership making the same, to the effect that the statements contained
      therein  are  true.  The  fact  that an individual's name is signed on a
      certification attached to  a  corporate  report  shall  be  prima  facie
      evidence  that  such  individual  is authorized to certify the report on
      behalf of the corporation. Such reports shall  contain  any  other  data
      information  or  matter which the commissioner of finance may require to
      be included therein, and it may prescribe the form in which such reports
      shall be made. When so prescribed such forms shall be used in making the
      report. The commissioner of finance may require at any time a further or
      supplemental  report  under  this   subchapter   which   shall   contain
      information  and  data  upon such matters as the commissioner of finance
      may specify. Reports shall be preserved for five years,  and  thereafter
      until the commissioner of finance orders them to be destroyed.

      sections 11-662 and 11-663 of this subchapter shall be due  and  payable
      at  the  time  of the filing of the report required by section 11-667 of

      thirtieth, or, in case such report is not filed when due,  on  the  last

      the commissioner of finance prior to the commencement of any tax year or
      period by a corporation subject  to  tax  under  this  subchapter,  such
      corporation  shall  not be liable for any tax imposed by this subchapter
      for such following year or period (except as may be  otherwise  provided
      in  section 11-664 of this subchapter), provided that the certificate of
      dissolution for such corporation is duly filed  in  the  office  of  the

      payment of any tax imposed by this subchapter under such  conditions  as
      the commissioner deems just and proper.
