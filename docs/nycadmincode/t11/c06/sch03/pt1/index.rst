Section 11-612 ::    
        
     
        §  11-612  Tax  based  on  net  income;  imposition;  minimum tax; new
      incorporations; dissolution; consolidations; mergers, etc.
        1. For the privilege of doing business in the city:
        (a) Every bank and savings and loan association  organized  under  the
      authority of this state;
        (b) Every trust company incorporated, organized or formed under, by or
      pursuant  to  a  law of the state, other than a trust company all of the
      stock of which is owned by not less than twenty savings banks  organized
      under  a  law of the state, and every domestic corporation authorized to
      do a trust company's business solely or in  connection  with  any  other
      business, under a general or special law of the state;
        (c) Every other domestic financial corporation;
        (d)  Every  incorporated  foreign  banker doing a banking business and
      every other foreign financial corporation; and
        (e) Every federal savings and  loan  association  located  within  the
      city,  shall  annually  pay  a  tax at the rate of four and one-half per
      centum except that for the years nineteen hundred seventy-one and  those
      following,  the  rate  shall  be five and sixty-three one hundredths per
      centum, to be computed as provided in this part, upon the basis  of  its
      net  income  for  each  calendar  year, beginning with the calendar year
      nineteen hundred sixty-six,  next  preceding  the  date  when  such  tax
      becomes  due,  if  the  taxpayer  is  required  to file a declaration of
      estimated tax and to make payments on account of such estimated  tax  as
      provided by section 11-636 of this subchapter, upon the basis of its net
      income  for  the calendar year with respect to which such declaration is
      required to be filed.
        2. Every such corporation for the privilege of doing business  in  the
      city  and every federal savings and loan association located in the city
      shall be subject to a minimum tax of not less than ten dollars  and  not
      less   than  one  mill  except  that  for  the  years  nineteen  hundred
      seventy-one and those following such minimum tax shall be not less  than
      twelve  and one-half dollars and not less than one and one-quarter mills
      upon each dollar of such a part of its issued capital stock on the  last
      day  of  the calendar year preceding that in which such tax becomes due,
      at its face value, as the gross income of such corporation derived  from
      business  carried on within the city during such calendar year, bears to
      its gross income derived from all business, both within and without  the
      city,  during said year, but if such a corporation has stock without par
      value, such stock shall be taken at its actual or market value, and  not
      less  than  five  dollars  per  share,  as  may  be  determined  by  the
      commissioner of finance; except that a savings bank and savings and loan
      association shall be subject to a minimum tax of not less than an amount
      equal to two per centum of the amount of interest or dividends  credited
      by  it  to depositors or shareholders during the calendar year preceding
      that in which such tax becomes due except that for  the  years  nineteen
      hundred  seventy-one  and  those following such minimum tax shall be not
      less than twelve and one-half dollars and not less than an amount  equal
      to  two  and  one-half per centum of the amount of interest or dividends
      credited by it to depositors or shareholders during  the  calendar  year
      preceding  that  in  which  such  tax  becomes  due,  provided  that, in
      determining such amount each interest or dividend credit to a  depositor
      or  shareholder  shall be deemed to be the interest or dividend actually
      credited or the interest or dividend which would have been  credited  if
      it  had  been  computed  and  credited at the rate of two per centum per
      annum whichever is less and except also that in  the  case  of  a  trust
      company or savings bank incorporated in the calendar year preceding that
      in  which  its  first  return under this part shall be due and after the
      thirtieth day of June in such year, the minimum tax, computed as in this
    
      subdivision provided, shall be reduced one-twelfth for  each  month,  or
      major  portion  thereof, subsequent to said thirtieth day of June during
      which such trust company or savings bank did not exercise the  privilege
      of doing business in the city.
        3.  For  the  privilege  of  doing  business  in  the city, every such
      domestic corporation, except trust companies and savings banks, shall be
      subject to a tax  for  the  calendar  year  in  which  its  organization
      certificate  is  filed,  and, for the privilege of doing business in the
      city, every such foreign corporation shall be subject to a tax  for  the
      calendar  year  in  which it first does business in the city, and, every
      federal savings and loan association located within the  city  shall  be
      subject to a tax for the calendar year in which it first becomes located
      within the city, computed in the same manner and at the same rate as the
      minimum  tax  under  subdivision  two  of  this section, except that the
      income forming the basis for proration shall  be  the  income  for  such
      calendar  year,  and  the  issued capital stock shall be taken as of the
      last day of such calendar year;  provided,  however,  that  the  tax  so
      computed  shall  be reduced one-twelfth for each month, or major portion
      thereof, in such calendar year, during which such  corporation  was  not
      doing  business  in  the  city,  or,  if  a  federal  savings  and  loan
      association, was not located in the city, and in no event shall the  tax
      be  less  than  ten  dollars  except  that for the year nineteen hundred
      seventy-one and those following, in no event shall the tax be less  than
      twelve and one-half dollars.
        4.  For  the privilege of doing business in the city, every such trust
      company and savings bank which shall  become  incorporated  between  the
      thirty-first day of December and the succeeding first day of July, shall
      be  subject to a tax for such period, computed in the same manner and at
      the same rate as the minimum tax under subdivision two of this  section,
      except  that  the  income  forming  the basis for proration shall be the
      income for such period;  and  the  issued  capital  stock,  or  interest
      credited  to depositors of a savings bank, shall be taken as of the last
      day of such period; provided, however, that the tax so computed shall be
      reduced one-half and an additional one-twelfth for each month, or  major
      portion  thereof,  in  such  period,  during which such trust company or
      savings bank was not doing business in the city, and in no  event  shall
      the  tax  be  less  than  ten  dollars except that for the year nineteen
      hundred seventy-one and those following, in no event shall  the  tax  be
      less than twelve and one-half dollars.
        5.  For  the  privilege  of  doing  business  in  the city, every such
      corporation, except trust companies and savings banks,  which  shall  be
      dissolved  between  the  thirty-first day of December and the succeeding
      second day of September, and shall not  become  merged  or  consolidated
      with another corporation taxable under this part and, every such foreign
      corporation which shall cease to do business in the city during the same
      period,  and  every federal savings and loan association which ceases to
      be located in the city during the same  period,  and  shall  not  become
      merged or consolidated with another corporation taxable under this part,
      shall  pay a tax for the period from the thirty-first day of December up
      to the time of dissolution, ceasing to  do  business  in  the  city,  or
      ceasing  to  be  located  in the city, as the case may be, equal to that
      which would have been payable had it not been dissolved,  ceased  to  do
      business  in  the city, or ceased to be located in the city, except that
      such tax shall be reduced one-third and an  additional  one-twelfth  for
      each  month,  or  major portion thereof, prior to such succeeding second
      day of September, during which such corporation was not  doing  business
      in  the  city, or was not located in the city, and in no event shall the
      tax be less than ten dollars except that for the year  nineteen  hundred
    
      seventy-one  and those following, in no event shall the tax be less than
      twelve and one-half dollars. If such  dissolution  or  cessation  occurs
      beteween the fifteenth day of March and the second day of September, and
      if  such  corporation  shall  have  filed  its  return  on or before the
      fifteenth day of March as required by section 11-633 of this subchapter,
      it may file a claim for refund as provided in  section  11-678  of  this
      chapter,  showing  any  reduction  in tax to which it may be entitled as
      provided in the preceding sentence; and if it shall be  made  to  appear
      that  the  amount  of tax due is less than the amount as computed on the
      basis of the original return, the commissioner of finance  shall  adjust
      the  computation of tax accordingly. If the amount of tax as so adjusted
      shall be less than the amount theretofore  paid,  the  excess  shall  be
      refunded  by  the commissioner of finance as provided in subdivision one
      of section 11-677 of this chapter.
        6.  Every  such  trust  company  and  savings  bank,  which  shall  be
      dissolved,  and  shall  not  become  merged or consolidated with another
      corporation taxable under this part, shall, if dissolution  takes  place
      between  the  thirtieth  day  of  June  and  the succeeding first day of
      January, be subject to a tax, for that part of such period in  which  it
      had  been  doing  business,  computed in the same manner and at the same
      rate as the minimum tax under subdivision two of  this  section,  except
      that  the income forming the basis for proration shall be the income for
      the calendar year in which  such  dissolution  occurs;  and  the  issued
      capital  stock,  or  interest  credited to depositors of a savings bank,
      shall be taken as of the date of dissolution;  provided,  however,  that
      the  tax  so  computed  shall  be  reduced  one-half  and  an additional
      one-twelfth for each month, or major portion thereof, between  the  date
      of  dissolution  and the succeeding first day of January. If dissolution
      occurs between the thirty-first  day  of  December  and  the  succeeding
      sixteenth  day  of  March,  such trust company and savings bank shall be
      subject to the same tax that would have been due from it  on  or  before
      the  fifteenth  day of March had it not been dissolved, except that such
      tax shall be reduced  one-twelfth  for  each  month,  or  major  portion
      thereof,  from  the  date  of dissolution to the succeeding first day of
      July, and shall be for the period beginning on the preceding  first  day
      of July and ending on the date of dissolution. In no event shall the tax
      under this subdivision be less than ten dollars except that for the year
      nineteen  hundred seventy-one and those following, in no event shall the
      tax under this subdivision be less than twelve and one-half dollars.
        7. In the case of a consolidation or merger of taxpayers, or in case a
      national bank taxable  under  part  two  of  this  subchapter  shall  be
      consolidated  or merged with a taxpayer under this part, or in case of a
      series of such transactions, there shall be added to the net  income  of
      the  taxpayer  resulting  from  such  consolidations  or mergers the net
      income of the taxpayers which are consolidated or merged for the  period
      for  which  the  taxpayer resulting from such consolidation or merger is
      required to render any return under this part,  and  if  such  resulting
      taxpayer  is a savings bank or savings and loan association, there shall
      be added to the interest or dividends credited by it  to  depositors  or
      shareholders  the amount of interest or dividends credited to depositors
      or  shareholders  during  such  period  by  the  taxpayers   which   are
      consolidated  or  merged,  except that net income, interest or dividends
      shall not be included if they have already been used as the basis for  a
      tax  under this part, and the tax payable on filing such return shall be
      based upon the entire net income reported therein  or  upon  the  entire
      amount  of  interest  or  dividends so reported, as the case may be. The
      acquisition by a taxpayer, directly or  indirectly,  of  the  assets  or
    
      franchises of another taxpayer or national bank shall be deemed a merger
      for the purposes of this section.
        8.  The  tax  imposed by this part shall be for the calendar year next
      preceding the year in which it becomes due; except that with respect  to
      corporations  subject  to  a  tax imposed under subdivision three, four,
      five or six of this section, the tax shall be  for  the  period  therein
      specified, and except that with respect to corporations required to file
      a  declaration  of estimated tax and to make payments on account of such
      estimated tax as provided by section  11-636  of  this  subchapter,  all
      payments of tax within a calendar year, whether computed on the basis of
      net  income  for the current calendar year or on the basis of net income
      for the preceding calendar year, shall be for the calendar year in which
      the payments are required to be made.
        9. In the event that it shall be finally  determined  by  a  court  of
      competent  jurisdiction  that  the  taxes  imposed  on  national banking
      associations by part two of  this  subchapter  are  unconstitutional  or
      invalid  for  the  reason  that  they  are  not  in  conformity with the
      provisions of section fifty-two hundred nineteen of  the  United  States
      revised  statutes,  then, in lieu of the taxes imposed by the provisions
      of this part, every corporation that otherwise would have  been  subject
      to  tax  under  this  part  shall  be  subject  to the tax imposed under
      subchapter two as of July thirteenth, nineteen  hundred  sixty-six,  and
      all  of  the provisions of subchapter two, unless clearly inappropriate,
      shall be applicable except subdivision four of section  11-603  of  this
      chapter; and, in such event, any payments made, reports or returns filed
      or  any  act of the commissioner of finance or of a taxpayer purportedly
      under this subchapter shall be treated as though  made,  filed  or  done
      pursuant to subchapter two.
        10.  Cross  reference. For years for which tax is imposed, see section
      11-613 of this part.

Section 11-614 ::    
        
     
        §  11-614  Ascertainment  of  gain  or  loss.  1.  For  the purpose of
      ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale  or  other
      disposition of property, real, personal or mixed, the basis shall be the
      cost  thereof,  or  the  inventoried  value  if the inventory is made in
      accordance with section 11-617 of this part.

      prior  to  January  first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-six, except stock in
      trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which  would  properly
      be  included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of
      the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to
      customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, and  accounts
      or notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of trade or business
      from  the  sale  of  such  stock  in  trade or property, or for services
      rendered, net income shall not include:
        (a) That portion of  the  gain  included  in  determining  net  income
      pursuant  to  subdivision  one of this section with respect to each such
      property, which exceeds:
        (b) The amount of gain that  would  be  included  in  determining  net
      income  pursuant to subdivision one of this section with respect to each
      such property if the basis of such property on the date of sale or other
      disposition were equal to  its  fair  market  value  on  January  first,
      nineteen  hundred sixty-six, plus or minus all adjustments to basis made
      with respect to each such property in computing net income  for  periods
      on  or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six provided that the
      total adjustment to net income provided by this  subdivision  shall  not
      exceed  the  amount  of  the  taxpayer's net gain from the sale or other
      disposition of all such property, as determined pursuant to  subdivision
      one of this section.
        3.  In  the  case  of  any bond, with respect to which a deduction for
      amortizable bond premium is allowable under subdivision nine of  section

      reduced by the total amount of such deductions so allowable.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-615
--------------

Section 11-615 ::    
        
     
        §  11-615  Exchange of property. Upon the sale or exchange of property
      the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under  section  11-614
      of  this  part,  shall  be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in
      this section:
        1. No  gain  or  loss  shall  be  recognized  if  common  stock  in  a
      corporation   is   exchanged   solely  for  common  stock  in  the  same
      corporation, or if preferred stock in a corporation is exchanged  solely
      for preferred stock in the same corporation;
        2.  No  gain  or  loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a
      corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan or
      reorganization,  exchanged  solely  for  stock  or  securities  in  such
      corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization;
        3.  No  gain  or  loss shall be recognized if a taxpayer, a party to a
      reorganization,  exchanges  property,  in  pursuance  of  the  plan   of
      reorganization,  solely for stock or securities in another corporation a
      party to the reorganization; and
        4. No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a
      corporation by a taxpayer solely in exchange for stock or securities  in
      such corporation, and immediately after the exchange such taxpayer is in
      control of the corporation; but in the case of an exchange by a taxpayer
      and  one  or  more  other corporations or persons this subdivision shall
      apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is
      substantially in proportion to its interest in the property prior to the
      exchange.
        5. If property (as a result of its destruction in whole  or  in  part,
      theft  or  seizure,  or  an  exercise  of  the  power  of requisition or
      condemnation, or the threat of imminence  thereof)  is  compulsorily  or
      involuntarily  converted  into property similar or related in service or
      use to the property so converted, or into money which  is  forthwith  in
      good faith, under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of finance,
      expended  in  the  acquisition  of  other property similar or related in
      service or use to the property so converted, or in  the  acquisition  of
      control  of  a  corporation  owning  such  other  property,  or  in  the
      establishment  of  a  replacement  fund,  no  gain  or  loss  shall   be
      recognized.  If  any  part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if
      any, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess  of  the  money
      which is not so expended.
        6.  If there is distributed, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization,
      to  a  taxpayer  shareholder  in  a   corporation   a   party   to   the
      reorganization,  stock  or  securities in such corporation or in another
      corporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such
      taxpayer shareholder of stock or securities in such  a  corporation,  no
      gain  to  the  distributee  from the receipt of such stock or securities
      shall be recognized.
        7. If an exchange would be within the provisions of  subdivision  one,
      two,  or  four  of  this  section  if  it were not for the fact that the
      property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by
      such subdivision to be received without the  recognition  of  gain,  but
      also of other property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient
      shall  be  recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such
      money and the fair market value of such other property.
        8. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision  three
      of  this  section if it were not for the fact that the property received
      in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted  by  such
      subdivision  to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of
      other property or money, then:
    
        (a) If the taxpayer receiving such other property or money distributes
      it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to  the  taxpayer
      shall be recognized from the exchange, but
        (b)  If  the  taxpayer receiving such other property or money does not
      distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the  gain,  if
      any, to the taxpayer shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess
      of  the  sum  of  such  money  and  the  fair market value of such other
      property so received, which is not so distributed.
        9. If an exchange would be within the provisions of  subdivision  one,
      two, three, or four of this section if it were not for the fact that the
      property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by
      such subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain or loss,
      but  also  of  other  property  or money, then no loss from the exchange
      shall be recognized.
        10. As used in this section:
        The  term  "reorganization"  means  (a)  a  merger  or   consolidation
      (including  the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of
      the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number  of  shares
      of  all  other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially
      all the properties of another corporation),  or  (b)  a  transfer  by  a
      corporation  of  all  or  a part of its assets to another corporation if
      immediately after the transfer the transferor  or  its  stockholders  or
      both  are  in  control  of  the  corporation  to  which  the  assets are
      transferred, or  (c)  a  recapitalization,  or  (d)  a  mere  change  in
      identity, form or place of organization, however effected;
        The  term  "a  party  to  a  reorganization"  includes  a  corporation
      resulting from a reorganization and includes both  corporations  in  the
      case  of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the
      voting stock and at least a majority of the total number  of  shares  of
      all other classes of stock of another corporation; and
        The  term  "control" means the ownership of at least eighty per centum
      of the voting stock and at least eighty per centum of the  total  number
      of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.
        11. No gain or loss shall be recognized upon the receipt by a taxpayer
      of  property  distributed  in complete liquidation of a corporation. For
      the purposes of this subdivision a distribution shall be  considered  to
      be in complete liquidation only if:
        (a)  the  taxpayer  receiving  such  property  was, on the date of the
      adoption of the plan of liquidation, and has  continued  to  be  at  all
      times  until  the  receipt  of the property, the owner of stock (in such
      corporation) possessing at least eighty per centum of the total combined
      voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and the  owner  of
      at  least  eighty  per centum of the total number of shares of all other
      classes of stock (except non-voting stock which is limited and preferred
      as to dividends), and was at no  time  on  or  after  the  date  of  the
      adoption  of  the  plan  of  liquidation  and  until  the receipt of the
      property the owner of a greater percentage of any class  of  stock  than
      the  percentage  of  such  class owned at the time of the receipt of the
      property; and either:
        (b) the distribution is by such corporation in  complete  cancellation
      or  redemption  of  all  its stock, and the transfer of all the property
      occurs  within  the  base  year;  in  such  case  the  adoption  by  the
      shareholders   of   the   resolution   under  which  is  authorized  the
      distribution  of  all  the  assets  of  the  corporation   in   complete
      cancellation  or  redemption  of  all  its stock, shall be considered an
      adoption of  a  plan  of  liquidation,  even  though  no  time  for  the
      completion  of  the  transfer  of  the  property  is  specified  on such
      resolution; or
    
        (c) such distribution is one of a  series  of  distributions  by  such
      corporation  in  complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock in
      accordance with a plan of liquidation under which the  transfer  of  all
      the property under the liquidation is to be completed within three years
      from  the close of the year during which is made the first of the series
      of distributions under the plan, except that if  such  transfer  is  not
      completed  within  such  period,  or  if  the taxpayer does not continue
      qualified under paragraph (a) until the completion of such transfer,  no
      distribution  under  the  plan  shall  be  considered  a distribution in
      complete liquidation.
        If such transfer of all the property does not occur within  the  year,
      the  commissioner  of  finance may require of the taxpayer such bond, or
      waiver of the statute of limitations on assessment  and  collection,  or
      both,  as the commissioner may deem necessary to insure, if the transfer
      of the property is not completed within such three year  period,  or  if
      the  taxpayer  does not continue qualified under paragraph (a) until the
      completion of such transfer, the assessment and collection of all  taxes
      then  imposed  under this part for such year or subsequent years, to the
      extent attributable to property so received.  A  distribution  otherwise
      constituing a distribution in complete liquidation within the meaning of
      this  paragraph  shall  not  be  considered  as  not constituting such a
      distribution merely because it does not  constitute  a  distribution  or
      liquidation  within  the  meaning  of  the corporate law under which the
      distribution is made; and for the purposes of this paragraph a  transfer
      of  property of such corporation to the taxpayer shall not be considered
      as not constituting a distribution (or one of a series of distributions)
      in complete  cancellation  or  redemption  of  all  the  stock  of  such
      corporation,  merely  because the carrying out of the plan involves: (1)
      the transfer under the plan to  the  taxpayer  by  such  corporation  of
      property,  not  attributable  to  shares  owned by the taxpayer, upon an
      exchange described in subdivision three of this  section,  and  (2)  the
      complete  cancellation  or  redemption  under  the  plan, as a result of
      exchanges described in subdivision two of this section,  of  the  shares
      not owned by the taxpayers.

      property is exchanged for other property and no gain or loss is realized
      under the provisions of the preceding  section,  the  property  received
      shall be treated as taking the place of the property exchanged therefor.
      Where  no  gain  or loss is realized under the provisions of subdivision
      eleven of the preceding section, the  basis  of  the  property  received
      shall  be  the  same  as  it  would  be  in  the hands of the transferor
      determined in accordance with the provisions of section 11-614  of  this

      determine  the  income of any taxpayer, inventory shall be taken by such
      taxpayer upon such basis as the commissioner of finance  may  prescribe,
      conforming  as  nearly  as may be to the best accounting practice in the
      banking business most clearly reflecting the income.

      in accordance with  the  method  of  accounting  regularly  employed  in
      keeping  the books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting
      has been so employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect
      the income, the computation shall be made upon such basis  and  in  such
      manner  as  in  the  opinion of the commissioner of finance does clearly
      reflect the income. In determining net income, war losses,  taxation  of
      property   recovered,   and  basis  of  property  shall  be  treated  in
      substantially the same manner as such losses, recoveries and  basis  are
      treated  under  the  applicable  provisions  of section thirteen hundred
      thirty-one of the internal revenue code.

--------------

Section 11-620 ::    
        
     
        §  11-620  Gross  income  defined. 1. The term "gross income" includes
      gains, profits and income derived from the business,  of  whatever  kind
      and  in  whatever  form  paid,  including  gains, profits or income from
      dealings in property, whether real or personal,  or  gains,  profits  or
      income  received  as  compensation  for  services,  as  interest, rents,
      commissions, brokerage or other fees, or otherwise in carrying  on  such
      business,  including  all  dividends received on stocks and all interest
      received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds.
        2. If the gross income of a taxpayer is derived from business  carried
      on  both  within  and  without  the  city,  "gross  income"  means  that
      proportion thereof which is derived from business carried on within  the
      city, to be allocated and determined on the basis of separate accounting
      for  each  office  or  branch or, at the election of the taxpayer, under
      rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner of finance.
        3. "Gross income" of a savings bank shall include the amount  received
      by it in any taxable year as a distribution in liquidation of the mutual
      savings bank fund.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-621
--------------

Section 11-621 ::    
        
     
        § 11-621 Deductions. In computing net income there shall be allowed as
      deductions:
        1. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the
      year  in  carrying  on  business,  including  a reasonable allowance for
      salaries or other compensation for personal services actually  rendered,
      and  including  rentals  or  other  payments  required  to  be made as a
      condition to the continued use or possession for  business  purposes  of
      property  to  which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or
      in which such taxpayer has no equity.
        2. All interest paid or accrued during the year on indebtedness.
        3. Taxes, other than taxes on income or profits paid or accrued within
      the year, imposed, first, by the authority of the United States,  or  of
      any  of  its  possessions, or, second, by the authority of any state, or
      territory, or any county, school district, municipality, or other taxing
      subdivisions of any state or territory,  not  including  those  assessed
      against  local  benefits  of a kind tending to increase the value of the
      property  assessed,  or,  third,  by  the  authority  of   any   foreign
      government.
        4.  Losses  sustained  during  the  year  and  not  compensated for by
      insurance or otherwise, if incurred in  business;  unless  in  order  to
      clearly  reflect  the  income  the  losses  should in the opinion of the
      commissioner of finance be accounted for as of a  different  period.  No
      deduction  shall  be allowed for any loss claimed to have been sustained
      in any sale or other disposition of shares of stock or securities  where
      it appears that within thirty days before or after the date such sale or
      other  disposition  the  taxpayer  has  acquired substantially identical
      property, and the property so acquired is held by the taxpayer  for  any
      period  after  such sale or other disposition, unless such claim is made
      with respect to a transaction made in the ordinary course  of  business.
      If  such  acquisition  is  to  the  extent of part only of substantially
      identical property, only a proportionate  part  of  the  loss  shall  be
      disallowed.
        5.  Debts ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the year;
      or in the  discretion  of  the  commissioner  of  finance  a  reasonable
      addition  to  a  reserve  for  bad  debts. When satisfied that a debt is
      recoverable only in part, the commissioner of  finance  may  allow  such
      debt to be charged off in part.
        6.  A  reasonable  allowance  for  the  exhaustion,  wear  and tear of
      property  used  in  business,  including  a  reasonable  allowance   for
      obsolescence.  In  the case of any such property acquired before January
      first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of such deduction shall be
      equal to the deduction properly taken for such property in reporting the
      tax due pursuant to article nine-b of  the  tax  law.  With  respect  to
      property  such  as described in subdivision twelve of this section, this
      deduction may be computed and allowed as provided therein.
        7. If the gross income be derived from business carried on within  and
      without  the  city,  the  deductions  allowed  by  this section shall be
      allocated and determined on the basis of separate  accounting  for  each
      office  or  branch  or, at the election of the taxpayer, under rules and
      regulations to be prescribed by the commissioner of finance.
        8. In the case of any taxpayer who establishes or maintains a  pension
      trust  to  provide  for  the  payment  of  reasonable  pensions  to  its
      employees, there shall be allowed as a deduction  (in  addition  to  the
      contributions to such trust during the taxable year to cover the pension
      liability  accruing  during  the  year,  allowed  as  a  deduction under
      subdivision one of this section) a reasonable amount transferred or paid
      into such trust during the taxable year in excess of such contributions,
      but only if such amount (a) has not  theretofore  been  allowable  as  a
    
      deduction,  and  (b)  is apportioned in equal parts over a period of ten
      consecutive years beginning with the  year  in  which  the  transfer  or
      payment  is  made  or, under regulations of the commissioner of finance,
      covers  not  more  than  one-tenth  of  the total pension liability with
      respect to services rendered prior to such taxable year;  provided  that
      said  deduction  shall  be allowable only with respect to a taxable year
      (whether the year of the transfer or payment or a  subsequent  year)  of
      the  taxpayer  ending  within  or  with a taxable year of the trust with
      respect to which the trust, by reason of its purposes or activities,  is
      exempt from federal income tax.
        9.  The  amount of the amortizable bond premium on a bond for the year
      shall be allowed as a deduction as hereinafter  provided.  In  computing
      such  deduction:  (a) the amount of the bond premium shall be determined
      with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on  sale
      or  exchange)  of such bond, and with reference to the amount payable on
      maturity or on earlier call date, with  adjustments  proper  to  reflect
      unamortized  bond premium with respect to the bond, for the period prior
      to July thirteenth, nineteen  hundred  sixty-six  with  respect  to  the
      taxpayer with respect to such bond, and (b) the amortizable bond premium
      of the year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such
      year. The determination required in the preceding sentence shall be made
      in  accordance  with  the  method  of  amortizing bond premium regularly
      employed by the holder of such bond, if such method is  reasonable,  and
      in all other cases in accordance with regulations of the commissioner of
      finance  prescribing reasonable methods of amortizing bond premium. This
      subdivision shall  apply  only  if  the  taxpayer  shall  so  elect,  in
      accordance  with  regulations  of  the commissioner of finance, and such
      election shall be  made  separately  with  respect  to  (1)  bonds,  the
      interest  of  which  is  wholly  taxable, and (2) bonds, the interest of
      which is wholly or partially tax exempt, for purposes of the income  tax
      imposed by chapter one of the internal revenue code. If such election is
      made  with  respect to any bond of the taxpayer described in clauses one
      or two hereof, it shall also apply to all bonds in the same  class  held
      by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first year to which the election
      applies  and  to  all  such bonds thereafter acquired by it and shall be
      binding for all subsequent years with respect to all such bonds  of  the
      taxpayer,  unless upon the application by the taxpayer, the commissioner
      of finance permits the taxpayer,  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the
      commissioner  of  finance  deems  necessary, to revoke such election. As
      used in this subdivision the term "bond" means any bond, debenture, note
      or  certificate  or  other  evidence  of  indebtedness,  issued  by  any
      corporation  and  bearing interest (including any like obligation issued
      by a government or political subdivision thereof), with interest coupons
      or in registered form, but does not include any  such  obligation  which
      constitutes  stock  in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a
      kind which would properly be included in the inventory of  the  taxpayer
      if  on hand at the close of the year, or any such obligation held by the
      taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course  of  its
      trade or business.
        10.  In  the  case of a savings bank and savings and loan association,
      amounts paid or  credited  to  depositors  or  holders  of  accounts  as
      interest  or  dividends  on  their deposits or withdrawable accounts, if
      such amounts are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice
      of intention to withdraw.
        11. A savings bank and savings and loan association may deduct in  any
      taxable year the amount of the repayment of any loan or advance from the
      mutual  savings  bank fund in computing its net income and the amount of
    
      interest or dividends subject to the minimum tax under subdivision three
      of section 11-612 of this part.
        12.  (a)  At the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted from
      gross income, or if gross income is derived  from  business  carried  on
      within  and without this city, from the portion thereof allocated within
      the city, depreciation with respect to any property such as described in
      paragraph (b) of this subdivision, not exceeding twice the  depreciation
      allowed  with  respect  to  the  same  property  for  federal income tax
      purposes.
        (b) Such deduction shall be allowed  only  with  respect  to  tangible
      property   which   is   depreciable  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred
      sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs  in  this  city
      and  used  in the taxpayer's business, (i) constructed, reconstructed or
      erected  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred   sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract  which was on or before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
      the  taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or
      erection of which began on or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
      hundred  sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order
      placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven,
      and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof which is
      properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction  or  erection
      after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,  or  (ii)
      acquired  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,
      pursuant  to  a  contract which was, on or before December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times  thereafter,  binding  on
      the  taxpayer  or  pursuant  to  an  order  placed on or before December
      thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase  as  defined  in
      section  one  hundred  seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if
      the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced
      in this city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-five, or (iii) acquired,  constructed,  reconstructed  or  erected
      subsequent  to  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if
      such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection  is  pursuant
      to  a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially  modified,
      and  such  acquisition,  construction,  reconstruction or erection would
      qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h)
      of section  forty-eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code  provided  all
      references  in  such  paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October
      nine, nineteen hundred  sixty-six  and  October  ten,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-six  shall  be  read  as  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under  clause  (i),
      (ii)  or  (iii) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be
      delivered or the  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  shall  be
      completed   on   or   before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which  is  acquired,
      constructed,  reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was,
      on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at
      all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer.  Provided,  however,  for
      any  taxable  year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred
      sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph
      (a) hereof with respect to tangible personal property leased  by  it  to
      any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
      any  contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such
      property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the
      taxpayer uses itself for purposes other  than  leasing  for  part  of  a
      taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall
    
      be  allowed a deduction under paragraph (a) in proportion to the part of
      the year it uses such property.
        (c)  If  the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this
      subdivision exceeds the  taxpayer's  net  income  computed  without  the
      allowance  of  such deduction and without the allowance of any deduction
      pursuant to subdivision six of this section with references to the  same
      property,  the  excess may be carried over to the following taxable year
      or years and may be deducted in computing net income for  such  year  or
      years.
        (d)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
      of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to  this
      subdivision, the gain or loss thereon shall be computed by adjusting the
      basis  of such property to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the
      taxpayer's gross income is derived from business carried on both  within
      and  without  the  city,  shall  be allocated within the city. Provided,
      however, that no loss shall be  recognized  for  the  purposes  of  this
      paragraph  with  respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a
      person whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section
      one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code.
