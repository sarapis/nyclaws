      such  organization  shall  not  fail  to  meet  the  requirement of such

        (2) For purposes of this  subdivision,  the  term  "qualified  amateur
      sports  organization"  means  any  organization  organized  and operated
      exclusively  to  foster  national  or   international   amateur   sports

      period for which such lease may be in effect is one year or more as  the
      result  of  the  right  to  exercise  an  option  to renew or other like
      provision.

Section 11-2052 ::    
        
     
        * § 11-2052 Administration and collection; penalties; refunds. (a) The
      taxes  imposed by this subchapter shall be administered and collected by
      the tax commission in the same manner as the taxes  imposed  by  article
      twenty-eight  of  the  tax  law  are  administered and collected by such
      commission. All of  the  provisions  of  such  article  relating  to  or
      applicable  to the administration and collection of the taxes imposed by
      that article shall apply  to  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  subchapter,
      including  section  eleven  hundred  one  and  sections  eleven  hundred
      thirty-one through eleven hundred forty-seven, with the same  force  and
      effect  as  if  those provisions had been incorporated in full into this
      subchapter and had expressly referred  to  the  taxes  imposed  by  this
      subchapter,  except  to  the  extent that any provisions of such article
      twenty-eight  are  either  inconsistent  with  a   provision   of   this
      subchapter,  or  of  article  twenty-nine  of  the  tax  law, or are not
      relevant to this subchapter or to article twenty-nine of  the  tax  law.
      For  purposes  of  this  subchapter,  the  term "tax" in part IV of such
      article twenty-eight shall include the taxes imposed by this subchapter.
        (b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a)  of  this  section  or  any  other
      provision  of  law to the contrary, the tax commission shall, subject to
      such terms and conditions as it may consider necessary, delegate to  the
      commissioner   of  finance  the  power  and  authority  to  develop  and
      administer reasonable and necessary procedures,  including  the  use  of
      exemption  certificates  for  presentation  to  vendors, for determining
      entitlement to exemption from  tax  under  subdivision  (d)  of  section
      11-2051 of this subchapter, and to prescribe, subject to the approval of
      the  tax  commission, rules and regulations necessary and appropriate in
      carrying out such responsibilities.
        (c) Any person who, in violation of any provision of  subdivision  (d)
      of  section  11-2051  of this code or any rule or regulation promulgated
      thereunder, obtains or uses a certificate of exemption relating  to  the
      exemption  allowed by such subdivision, shall, if such violation was due
      to negligence or intentional disregard of  such  provision  or  rule  or
      regulation  (but  without intent to defraud), be liable for a penalty of
      not more than one hundred dollars for each such violation, and, if  such
      violation  was  due  to  fraud, be liable for a penalty of not more than
      five hundred dollars  for  each  such  violation.  The  commissioner  of
      finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce
      or  compromise  any  penalty  imposed  pursuant to this subdivision. The
      penalties authorized by this subdivision shall be  in  addition  to  any
      penalty  provided  by  section eleven hundred forty-five of the tax law,
      and shall be paid and disposed of, and, if unpaid, shall be  determined,
      assessed,  collected  and  enforced,  in  the  same  manner as the taxes
      imposed by this subchapter.
        (d)  Notwithstanding  subdivision  (d)  of  section  11-2051  of  this
      subchapter,  section  eleven  hundred  thirty-nine of the tax law or any
      other provision of law to the contrary, an individual resident shall not
      be entitled to a refund or credit with respect  to  any  amount  of  tax
      which  was  paid  to a vendor prior to the date such individual resident
      presented to the vendor a valid certificate of exemption from such tax.

Section 11-2053
---------------

Section 11-2053 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2053  Deposit and disposition of revenue. (a) The tax commission
      shall deposit daily to the credit of the comptroller of the state of New
      York, all taxes, penalties and interest collected under this  subchapter
      in  such  responsible banks, banking houses or trust companies as may be
      designated by the comptroller. Such deposits shall be kept in trust  for
      the  city and separate and apart from all other monies in the possession
      of the comptroller. The comptroller shall require adequate security from
      all such depositories. Of the revenue collected  under  this  subchapter
      the  comptroller  shall  retain  in  his or her hands such amount as the
      commissioner of taxation and finance  of  the  state  of  New  York  may
      determine  to  be  necessary  for  refunds under this subchapter and for
      reasonable costs of the tax commission in administering, collecting  and
      distributing   the  taxes  under  this  subchapter,  out  of  which  the
      comptroller shall pay any refunds made  under  the  provisions  of  this
      subchapter.  The  comptroller, after reserving such refund fund and such
      costs shall, on or before the twelfth day of  each  month,  pay  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance of this city all taxes, interest and penalties
      collected under this subchapter during the next preceding calendar month
      and remaining to the comptroller's credit in such banks, banking  houses
      or  trust  companies  at  the  close of business on the last day of such
      preceding month, provided, however, that the  comptroller  shall  on  or
      before  the  last  day  of  June  and  December  make  a partial payment
      consisting of the  collections  made  during  and  including  the  first
      twenty-five  days  of said months to the commissioner of finance of this
      city. The amount so payable shall be certified to the comptroller by the
      president of the tax commission or such president's delegate, who  shall
      not  be  held  liable  for any inaccuracy in such certificate. Provided,
      however, any such certification may be based on such information as  may
      be  available to the tax commission at the time such certificate must be
      made under this section and may be estimated on the basis of percentages
      or other indices calculated from distributions for prior periods.  Where
      the  amount  so  paid over in any such distribution is more or less than
      the amount then due to this city,  the  amount  of  the  overpayment  or
      underpayment  shall  be certified to the comptroller by the president of
      the tax commission or such president's delegate, who shall not  be  held
      liable  for  any  inaccuracy  in  such  certificate.  The  amount of the
      overpayment or underpayment shall be so certified to the comptroller  as
      soon   after  the  discovery  of  the  overpayment  or  underpayment  as
      reasonably possible and subsequent payments  and  distributions  by  the
      comptroller  to this city shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of
      any  such  overpayment  from  or  by  adding  the  amount  of  any  such
      underpayment  to such number of subsequent payments and distributions as
      the comptroller and the president of the tax commission  shall  consider
      reasonable  in view of the amount of the overpayment or underpayment and
      all other facts and circumstances.
        (b)  All  payments  to  the  commissioner  of  finance   pursuant   to
      subdivision  (a)  of  this section shall be credited to and deposited in
      the general fund of this city.
