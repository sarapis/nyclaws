      rates:
        (1) twelve cents per gallon upon beers; and
        (2) twenty-six and four-tenths cents per liter upon liquors, when sold
      or  used  within  this  city,  except  when  sold  or  used  under  such

      promulgated  by  the  appropriate executive agency of the United States,
      and except when sold to professional  foreign  consuls-general,  consuls
      and  vice-consuls who are nationals of the state appointing them and who
      are assigned to foreign consulates in this city provided  that  American
      consular  officers  of  equal rank who are citizens of the United States
      and who exercise their official functions at American consulates in such
      foreign country are granted reciprocal  exemptions;  provided,  however,
      that  the tax commission may permit the sale of alcohol without tax to a
      holder of any industrial  alcohol  permit,  alcohol  permit  or  alcohol
      distributor's  permit,  issued by the state liquor authority, and by the
      holder of an alcohol distributor's  permit,  class  A,  issued  by  such
      authority  to  a  holder  of a distiller's license, class B, or a winery
      license, issued by such authority and may also permit the use of alcohol
      for any purpose other than the production of alcoholic beverages by such
      holders without tax.
        Notwithstanding any  other  provision  of  this  subchapter,  the  tax
      commission may permit the purchase of liquors without tax by a holder of
      a  distiller's license issued by the state liquor authority from another
      holder of a distiller's license by such authority, in  which  event  the
      liquors  so  purchased  shall  be  subject  to  the  tax imposed by this
      subchapter in the hands of the purchaser in the same manner and  to  the
      same  extent  as if such purchaser had imported or caused the same to be
      imported into  this  city  or  had  produced,  distilled,  manufactured,
      brewed, compounded, mixed or fermented the same within this city.
        (b)  There  is  also  imposed on each person, other than a distributor
      within the meaning of this subchapter, who, on  August  first,  nineteen
      hundred  eighty,  owns  and  possesses for the purposes of sale beers or
      liquors, a floor tax at the rates applicable under subdivision (a)  upon
      such  beer  in  excess  of  one  hundred gallons and upon such liquor in
      excess of four hundred liters. Such floor tax shall be due  and  payable
      on  the  twentieth  day  of  the  month  succeeding the month of August,
      nineteen hundred eighty.
        (c) If, prior to August first, nineteen hundred eighty, a contract  of
      sale  of  alcoholic beverages was made, and delivery thereof pursuant to
      such contract is made  within  this  city  on  or  after  August  first,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty,  the vendor shall be deemed a distributor for
      the purposes of this subchapter, and such alcoholic beverages  shall  be
      deemed  to  be  sold, and shall be subject to such taxes, at the time of
      such delivery.
        (d) In any case where the  quantity  of  alcoholic  beverages  taxable
      pursuant  to  this  subchapter is a fractional part of one liter (or one
      gallon in the case of beers) or an amount greater than a whole  multiple
      of  liters  (or  gallons in the case of beers), the amount of tax levied
      and imposed on such fractional part of one liter (or one gallon  in  the
      case of beers), or fractional part of a liter (or gallon) in excess of a
      whole multiple of liters or gallons shall be such fractional part of the
      rate imposed by subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section.
    
        (e)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions of this subchapter, there
      shall be exempt from the taxes imposed under this subchapter, per month,
      one quart of alcoholic beverages (or one gallon of such beverages in the
      case of a person arriving directly from  American  Samoa,  Guam  or  the
      Virgin  Islands  of  the  United States not more than one quart of which
      shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such insular possessions):
        (1) purchased outside this city as an incident to a journey from which
      the purchaser is returning and
        (2) not to be offered for sale or used  for  any  commercial  purpose,
      provided  such  alcoholic  beverages accompany such person on his or her
      return to this city and provided, further, that in the case of a  person
      arriving  in  this  city  from  other  than a state of the United States
      (including the District of Columbia), the Virgin Islands of  the  United
      States  or  a  contiguous  country maintaining a free zone or free port,
      such person shall have remained beyond the  territorial  limits  of  the
      United States for a period of not less than forty-eight hours.
        Provided,  however,  where  the  amounts purchased outside the city or
      brought in exceed the amounts specified in this subdivision (e) but  are
      not in excess of one liter in the case of the references to one quart or
      four  liters  in  the  case of the reference to one gallon, and where no
      duty is required by the laws of the United States to  be  paid  on  such
      amounts,  such  metric  standards  of  fill shall be substituted for one
      quart and one gallon, respectively, and such  amounts  shall  be  exempt
      from tax under the conditions provided for in this subdivision (e).

Section 11-2059
---------------

Section 11-2059 ::    
        
     
        §  11-2059  Disposition of revenues. All taxes, penalties and interest

      shall  be deposited daily with such responsible banks, banking houses or
      trust companies, as may be designated by the state comptroller,  to  the
      credit  of  the comptroller, in trust for this city. Such deposits shall
      be kept in trust and separate and apart from all  other  monies  in  the
      possession  of  the  comptroller. The comptroller shall require adequate
      security from all such depositories of such revenues  collected  by  the
      tax  commission.  The  comptroller shall retain in his or her hands such
      amount as the commissioner of taxation and finance may determine  to  be
      necessary   for  refunds  in  respect  of  the  taxes  imposed  by  this
      subchapter, and for reasonable costs of  the  state  tax  commission  in
      administering,  collecting and distributing such taxes, out of which the
      comptroller shall pay any refunds of such taxes to which taxpayers shall
      be entitled under the provisions of this  subchapter.  The  comptroller,
      after  reserving  such  refund  and  such  costs shall, on or before the
      twelfth day of each month, pay to the commissioner of finance the  taxes
      penalties  and  interest  imposed  by  this subchapter, collected by the

      preceding  calendar  month.  The amount so payable shall be certified to
      the comptroller by the president of the state tax commission or  his  or
      her  delegate,  who  shall not be held liable for any inaccuracy in such
      certificate. Where the amount so paid over  to  the  city  in  any  such
      distribution  is  more or less than the amount then due to the city, the
      amount of the overpayment or underpayment  shall  be  certified  to  the
      comptroller  by  the president of the state tax commission or his or her
      delegate, who shall not be  held  liable  for  any  inaccuracy  in  such
      certificate.  The  amount of the overpayment or underpayment shall be so
      certified to  the  comptroller  as  soon  after  the  discovery  of  the
      overpayment  or  underpayment  as  reasonably  possible  and  subsequent
      payments and distributions by the  comptroller  to  the  city  shall  be
      adjusted  by  subtracting  the amount of any such overpayment from or by
      adding the amount of any such underpayment to such number of  subsequent
      payments  and  distributions as the comptroller and the president of the
      state tax commission shall consider reasonable in view of the amount  of
      the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts or circumstances.
