        § 11-802 Imposition of tax. a. In addition to any and all other taxes,
      including  the  compensating  use tax, there is hereby imposed and there
      shall be paid annually for each tax year beginning June first,  nineteen
      hundred sixty, a tax on the use in the city of motor vehicles to be paid
      by the owners of such vehicles as follows:
        1.  (A)  For  tax years ending on or before May thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred seventy-two, on commercial vehicles,  twenty  dollars  for  each
      such  vehicle  having  a  maximum gross weight of five tons or less, and
      thirty dollars for each such vehicle having a maximum  gross  weight  of
      more  than  five  tons,  provided,  however,  that for each such vehicle
      having a registration fee prescribed in the vehicle and traffic  law  of
      the  state  of New York which is less than twenty dollars, the tax shall
      be an amount equal to such registration fee;
        (B) For tax years beginning on and after June first, nineteen  hundred
      seventy-two   but   before  June  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety,  on
      commercial vehicles, forty  dollars  for  each  such  vehicle  having  a
      maximum  gross  weight  of five tons or less, and sixty dollars for each
      such vehicle having a maximum gross  weight  of  more  than  five  tons,
      provided,  however, that for each such vehicle having a registration fee
      prescribed in the vehicle and traffic law of the state of New York which
      is less than forty dollars, the tax shall be an  amount  equal  to  such
      registration fee.
        (C)  For tax years beginning on and after June first, nineteen hundred
      ninety, on commercial vehicles, forty  dollars  for  each  such  vehicle
      having  a  maximum  gross  weight  of  ten  thousand pounds or less, two
      hundred dollars for each such vehicle having a maximum gross  weight  of
      more  than  ten  thousand  pounds but not more than twelve thousand five
      hundred pounds, two hundred seventy-five dollars for each  such  vehicle
      having  a maximum gross weight of more than twelve thousand five hundred
      pounds but not more than  fifteen  thousand  pounds  and  three  hundred
      dollars for each such vehicle having a maximum gross weight of more than
      fifteen  thousand  pounds, provided, however, that for each such vehicle
      having a registration fee prescribed in the vehicle and traffic  law  of
      the state of New York which is less than forty dollars, the tax shall be
      an amount equal to such registration fee.
        2.  (A)  For  tax years ending on or before May thirty-first, nineteen
      hundred ninety, on motor vehicles for the transportation  of  passengers
      other than medallion taxicabs, and for tax years ending on or before May
      thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  eight-nine, on medallion taxicabs, one
      hundred dollars for each such vehicle.
        (B)  For  the  tax  year  beginning  June  first,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine  and  ending  May  thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety, on
      medallion taxicabs, five hundred dollars for each such vehicle.
        (C) For tax years beginning on and after June first, nineteen  hundred
      ninety,  on  medallion  taxicabs,  one  thousand  dollars  for each such
      vehicle,  and  on  all  other  motor  vehicles  for  transportation   of
      passengers, four hundred dollars for each such vehicle.
        b.  To  the  extent  that  the tax as imposed by subdivision a of this
      section may be invalid solely because it is based on the use in the city
      of the motor vehicles, the tax shall also be deemed to be based  on  the
      privilege  of  using  the public highways or streets of the city by such
      motor vehicle. Under such circumstances the rate of  tax  shall  be  the
      same  and  all  other  provisions  of  this  chapter  shall  be  equally
      applicable.
        c. If the first use of any motor vehicle subject to  the  tax  imposed
      hereunder  occurs  on  or after December first and before March first in
      any tax year, the tax for  that  year  shall  be  one-half  of  the  tax
      hereinabove  provided;  and,  if  the  first such use occurs on or after
    
      March first in any tax  year,  the  tax  for  that  tax  year  shall  be
      one-fourth of the tax hereinabove provided.
        d.  In  applying  the tax on commercial motor vehicles with respect to
      tractors, trailers and semi-trailers, the tax shall be measured  by  the
      weight  of  the  tractor plus the maximum gross weight of the trailer or
      semi-trailer with the greatest such maximum gross weight to be drawn  by
      such  tractor.  No  trailer  or  semi-trailer  shall  be  subject to any
      separate or additional tax under this chapter.

        b. In order to determine whether motor vehicles are subject to the tax
      under  this  chapter  and  to  facilitate  administration   thereof   an
      information  registration  certificate  in such form as is prescribed by
      the commissioner of finance shall be  filed  with  the  commissioner  of
      finance by any person who owns or acquires:
        1. A motor vehicle of a type described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of
      subdivision  three of section 11-801 of this chapter which is registered

Section 11-807 ::    
        
     
        §  11-807  Returns.  a. On or before the twentieth day of June in each
      year commencing with the year nineteen hundred sixty, every owner  of  a
      motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter shall file a return with
      the  commissioner  of finance. A supplemental return shall also be filed
      by every owner with regard to each motor vehicle subject to tax acquired
      during any tax year at a time subsequent to the filing  of  the  owner's
      regular  return.  Such  supplemental  return  shall  be  filed  with the
      commissioner of finance within a stated time, as fixed by regulation  of
      the commissioner of finance, after the acquisition of the motor vehicle.
      An  owner  who  acquires  a  motor  vehicle subject to the tax after the
      commencement  of  a  tax  year  and  who  has  not  filed  a  return  or
      supplemental  return  with  respect  to  such motor vehicle shall file a
      return with respect to it within two days after its acquisition  by  the
      owner.
        b.  The  commissioner of finance, by regulation, may require that each
      person required under this chapter to file an  information  registration
      certificate  file an information return with the commissioner of finance
      annually or at such other times as the  commissioner  deems  appropriate
      for  proper  administration of this chapter. The commissioner of finance
      may, by regulation, provide that information returns need not  be  filed
      or that they be filed at different times with respect to a type of motor
      vehicle  or  with  respect  to  any general group within a type of motor
      vehicle or with respect to any particular circumstances.
        c.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may  permit  or  require  returns,
      supplemental  returns  or information returns to be filed at times other
      than  those  specified  in  the  commissioner's  regulations.   If   the
      commissioner  deems  it  necessary in order to insure payment of the tax
      imposed by this chapter, the commissioner of  finance  may  require  any
      return,  supplemental  return or information return to be filed with him
      or her at a time other than that fixed by such commissioner.
        d. The form of returns, supplemental returns and  information  returns
      shall  be  prescribed  by  the commissioner of finance and shall contain
      such information as the commissioner may deem necessary for  the  proper
      administration  of this chapter. The commissioner of finance may require
      amended returns, amended supplemental  returns  or  amended  information
      returns  to  be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the
      information specified in the notice.
        e. If a return, supplemental  return  or  information  return  is  not
      filed,  or  if  a  return  of  any  kind  when  filed  is  incorrect  or
      insufficient on its face, the commissioner of  finance  shall  take  the
      necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected
      return.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-808
--------------

Section 11-808 ::    
        
     
        §  11-808  Payment  of  tax.  a.  At  the  time  of filing a return or
      supplemental return the owner shall pay to the commissioner  of  finance
      the tax imposed hereunder. Such tax shall be due and payable on the last
      day on which such return or supplemental return is required to be filed,
      regardless of whether such a return is filed or whether the return which
      is filed correctly indicates the amount of tax due.
        b. Where an owner of a motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter
      replaces  it  with  another  motor  vehicle during a tax year, the owner
      shall be entitled, upon approval by the commissioner of finance, to have
      any tax paid with respect to the replaced vehicle  credited  toward  the
      tax  payable  with respect to the replacement vehicle for the balance of
      such tax year, and the owner shall pay no additional tax  for  such  tax
      year  with  respect  to it unless its nature or its maximum gross weight
      requires the payment of a higher amount  of  tax  than  that  paid  with
      respect  to the replaced vehicle. A supplemental return, where required,
      shall be filed with respect to a  replacement  vehicle  irrespective  of
      whether  additional tax is payable. Upon the grant of a waiver of tax by
      the commissioner of finance a purchaser of a motor  vehicle  subject  to
      tax  under this chapter who purchases it during a tax year from an owner
      who has paid the tax shall not be required to pay the tax  with  respect
      to  such motor vehicle for the balance of such tax year if, and only if,
      the owner obtains, and submits to the commissioner of  finance  together
      with  his  or  her  return  or supplemental return, a certificate or its
      equivalent (as prescribed by the commissioner of finance) signed by  the
      prior  owner to the effect that the prior owner has not had the tax paid
      credited toward any replacement vehicle and will not seek to obtain such
      a credit for any replacement vehicle purchased in  the  future.  Nothing
      contained  in  this  subdivision  shall  be deemed to authorize a refund
      merely because a motor vehicle with respect to which the  tax  has  been
      paid is sold or otherwise disposed of during the course of the tax year.
        c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the tax
      imposed  on medallion taxicabs pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph
      two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter shall be due  and
      payable  in  two equal installments, the first of which shall be due and
      payable on or before the last day on which the  return  or  supplemental
      return for the tax year is required to be filed, and the second of which
      shall  be due and payable on or before the first day of December in such
      tax year; provided, however, that if a  medallion  taxicab  is  acquired
      subsequent  to  the  first  day  of  November in such tax year, the full
      amount of the tax imposed for the tax year shall be due and  payable  on
      or  before the last day on which the supplemental return with respect to
      such medallion taxicab is required to be filed.
        d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the tax
      imposed on medallion taxicabs pursuant to subparagraph (B) of  paragraph
      two  of  subdivision  a  of section 11-802 of this chapter shall, to the
      extent not previously paid, be due and payable  on  or  before  December
      first,  nineteen hundred eighty-nine; provided, however, that if the tax
      imposed on a medallion taxicab would, but for  the  provisions  of  this
      subdivision,  be  due and payable subsequent to December first, nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine, the due  date  of  such  tax  shall  be  determined
      without  regard to this subdivision; and provided, further, that nothing
      in this subdivision shall be deemed to extend the date  for  payment  of
      any  tax  imposed by paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of
      this chapter as such paragraph two was in effect  immediately  prior  to
      its amendment by the local law which added this subdivision.
        e. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or of chapter five of
      title  nineteen  of  this  code  to the contrary, the taxi and limousine
      commission may require by  rule  the  payment  of  the  tax  imposed  on
    
      medallion  taxicabs pursuant to this chapter as a condition precedent of
      the licensing or license renewal of such  medallion  taxicabs,  and  the
      taxi  and  limousine  commission  shall  have  the authority to deny the
      license  or  the renewal thereof for any medallion taxicab that fails to
      pay such tax.

        §  11-809  Stamps and other indicia of payment. a. The commissioner of
      finance may, by regulation, provide that the payment of the tax  imposed
      by  this  chapter shall be evidenced by suitable stamps or other indicia
      of payment in a form prescribed by the commissioner of finance and  that
      every  owner  shall affix such stamps or other indicia of payment in the
      manner prescribed by regulation to each motor vehicle for  which  a  tax
      had  been  paid, or shall otherwise keep the indicia of payment with the
      vehicle, readily available for inspection, in the manner  prescribed  by
      regulation.  The  owner  or  driver  of  the vehicle, upon demand, shall
      exhibit the indicia of payment to the commissioner  of  finance  or  the
      commissioner's  duly  authorized  agent  or  employee  or  to any police
      officer of this city or state.  The  commissioner  of  finance  may,  by
      regulation,  make  similar  provision  for  the  use  of stamps or other
      indicia that  no  tax  is  payable  with  respect  to  particular  motor
      vehicles.
        b.  An owner who sells a motor vehicle shall not transfer any stamp or
      other indicia of payment  to  the  purchaser  except  on  a  sale  to  a
      purchaser  to whom the owner has properly given the certificate provided
      for in section 11-808 of this chapter with regard  to  not  obtaining  a
      credit toward any tax payable with respect to a replacement vehicle. The
      commissioner   of   finance   shall,  by  regulation,  provide  for  the
      destruction of the stamp or other indicia of payment or  its  return  to
      the  commissioner of finance upon all sales except where transfer to the
      purchaser is permitted and,  where  the  motor  vehicle  sold  has  been
      replaced, for the issuance of replacement stamps or indicia of payment.

Section 11-809.1 ::    
        
     
        §  11-809.1  Collection  of  tax by commissioner of motor vehicles. a.
      Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary,  the  tax
      imposed  by  this chapter on any commercial motor vehicle with a maximum
      gross weight of ten thousand pounds or less and on any motor vehicle for
      transportation of passengers, other than a medallion taxicab,  shall  be
      collected  by the commissioner of motor vehicles, provided that any such
      motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered pursuant to any
      provision of section four hundred one of the vehicle  and  traffic  law.
      The  owner  of  each such motor vehicle shall pay the tax due thereon to
      the commissioner of motor vehicles on or before the date upon which such
      owner registers or renews the registration of such motor vehicle  or  is
      required  to  register  or  renew  the  registration thereof pursuant to
      section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.
        b. Notwithstanding any  provision  of  section  four  hundred  of  the
      vehicle and traffic law to the contrary, payment of the tax with respect
      to a motor vehicle described in subdivision a of this section shall be a
      condition precedent to the registration or renewal thereof of such motor
      vehicle  and  to  the  issuance  of  any certificate of registration and
      plates or removable date tag in accordance with the vehicle and  traffic
      law  and  the  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no such
      certificate of registration, plates or tag shall be issued  unless  such
      tax  has  been  paid.  If the registration period applicable to any such
      vehicle is a period of not less than two  years,  as  a  result  of  the
      application  of  the  provisions  of  paragraph c of subdivision five of
      section four hundred one  of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law,  the  tax
      required  to  be  paid  pursuant to this section shall be the annual tax
      specified in section 11-802 of this chapter multiplied by the number  of
      years  in  the  registration period. The commissioner of motor vehicles,
      upon payment of the tax pursuant to this section or upon the application
      of any person exempt therefrom, shall furnish to  each  taxpayer  paying
      the  tax  a  receipt  for  such tax and to each other taxpayer or exempt
      person  a  statement,  document  or  other  form   prescribed   by   the
      commissioner  of  motor vehicles, showing that such tax has been paid or
      is not due with respect to such motor vehicle.
        c. Notwithstanding the definition of the term "tax year" contained  in
      subdivision  fourteen of section 11-801 of this chapter, for purposes of
      the taxes payable to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this
      section, "tax year" shall  mean  the  twelve-month  registration  period
      applicable  to  the  subject motor vehicle under the vehicle and traffic
      law and, in the case of a registration period of  at  least  two  years,
      shall  mean  each  succeeding  twelve-month  period  falling within such
      registration period.
        d. Where the tax  imposed  by  this  chapter  has  been  paid  to  the
      commissioner  of  finance with respect to a motor vehicle for a tax year
      described in subdivision fourteen of section 11-801 of this chapter, and
      subsequent thereto but within such tax year the same taxpayer pays a tax
      to the commissioner of the motor vehicles with  respect  to  such  motor
      vehicle  pursuant  to this section, such taxpayer shall be entitled to a
      refund or credit from the commissioner of finance for the portion of the
      tax paid to the commissioner of finance which  is  attributable  to  the
      period  beginning  on  the  first day of the first tax year (as the term
      "tax year" is defined in subdivision c of this section)  for  which  the
      tax  is  paid  to  the  commissioner of motor vehicles and ending on the
      following May thirty-first, provided, however, that no  such  refund  or
      credit shall be allowed if the amount thereof is less than five dollars.
      Any  refund  or  credit to which a taxpayer is entitled pursuant to this
      subdivision shall be promptly refunded or credited, without interest, by
      the commissioner  of  finance,  and  the  commissioner  of  finance  may
    
      promulgate  such  rules  as  he  or she deems necessary to carry out the
      provisions of this subdivision. Any amount for  which  the  taxpayer  is
      entitled  to  a  refund  or  credit  pursuant to this subdivision may be
      allowed as a credit against the tax payable to the commissioner of motor
      vehicles  pursuant  to  this  section  to  the  extent and in the manner
      provided for in the  agreement  authorized  by  subdivision  k  of  this
      section.
        e. Whenever any fee or portion of a fee paid for the registration of a
      motor  vehicle  under  the  provisions of the vehicle and traffic law is
      refunded pursuant to the provisions  of  subdivision  one  or  one-a  of
      section four hundred twenty-eight thereof, the amount of any tax paid to
      the  commissioner  of  motor vehicles pursuant to this section upon such
      registration shall  also  be  refunded  by  the  commissioner  of  motor
      vehicles,  provided that where a fee is refunded pursuant to subdivision
      one-a of such section four hundred twenty-eight, the amount of tax to be
      refunded shall be limited to the tax paid  for  a  tax  year  commencing
      subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  first  twelve-month  period  of  such
      registration.
        f. Where the annual registration period  applicable  to  a  particular
      class  of  motor vehicle begins and ends on the same dates for all motor
      vehicles within such class, the tax payable to the commissioner of motor
      vehicles pursuant to this section with respect to a motor vehicle within
      such class which is registered or required to be  registered  after  the
      commencement  of such annual registration period shall be determined for
      such period as follows:
        1. If such motor vehicle is registered or required  to  be  registered
      before  the first day of the seventh month of such period, the tax shall
      be the amount specified in subdivision  a  of  section  11-802  of  this
      chapter.
        2. If such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered on
      or  after  the  first day of the seventh month of such period but before
      the first day of the tenth month  of  such  period,  the  tax  shall  be
      one-half  of  the amount specified in subdivision a of section 11-802 of
      this chapter.
        3. If such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered on
      or after the first day of the tenth month of such period, the tax  shall
      be one-fourth of the amount specified in subdivision a of section 11-802
      of this chapter.
        g.  The  provisions of subdivision b of section 11-808 of this chapter
      shall apply to this section with such modifications  or  adaptations  as
      are  necessary  to  carry out the purposes of this section and to ensure
      collection of the appropriate annual tax specified in subdivision  a  of
      section  11-802  of  this chapter, and with due regard to the respective
      responsibilities of the commissioner of finance and the commissioner  of
      motor  vehicles  under this section and to the definitions of "tax year"
      contained in subdivision c of this section and subdivision  fourteen  of
      section  11-801  of this chapter. The agreement between the commissioner
      of  finance  and  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  authorized  by
      subdivision k of this section may contain such provisions concerning the
      division  of  responsibility for collection of the taxes imposed by this
      chapter and the granting of refunds or credits as  are  consistent  with
      this  section  and  subdivision b of section 11-808 of this chapter, and
      the commissioner of finance and the commissioner of motor  vehicles  may
      also adopt such rules as they deem necessary for such purposes.
        h.  Notwithstanding any provision of section 11-807 of this chapter to
      the contrary, at  the  time  a  tax  is  required  to  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  pursuant  to this section, the person
      required to pay such tax shall file a return with  the  commissioner  of
    
      motor vehicles in such form and containing such information as he or she
      may  prescribe.  The  taxpayer's  application  for  registration  or the
      renewal  thereof  shall  constitute  the  return  required  under   this
      subdivision  unless  the  commissioner of motor vehicles shall otherwise
      provide by rule. A  return  filed  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  with
      respect  to  a motor vehicle for a tax year or years shall be in lieu of
      any return otherwise required to be filed with respect thereto  pursuant
      to section 11-807 of this chapter.
        i. In any case in which the tax imposed by this chapter is required to
      be  paid  to  the commissioner of motor vehicles but is not so paid, the
      commissioner of finance shall collect such tax and all of the provisions
      of this chapter relating to collection of taxes by the  commissioner  of
      finance shall apply with respect thereto.
        j.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  section  four  hundred of the
      vehicle and traffic law to the contrary, in those  cases  in  which  the
      commissioner of finance is responsible for collecting the tax imposed by
      this  chapter,  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles shall not issue a
      certificate of registration, plates or removable date tag for any  motor
      vehicle  subject  to  such tax with respect to which the commissioner of
      finance has notified the commissioner of motor vehicles  that  such  tax
      has  not  been  paid,  unless  the  registrant  submits proof, in a form
      approved by the commissioner of motor vehicles, that such tax  has  been
      paid, or is not due, with respect to such motor vehicle.
        k.  The  commissioner of finance is hereby authorized and empowered to
      enter into an agreement with  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  to
      govern  the  collection  of  the taxes imposed by this chapter which are
      required to be paid to the commissioner of motor  vehicles  pursuant  to
      this  section.  Such agreement shall provide for the exclusive method of
      collection, custody and remittal to the commissioner of finance  of  the
      proceeds  of any such tax; for the payment by the city of the reasonable
      expenses incurred by the department of motor vehicles in connection with
      the collection of any such tax; for the commissioner of  finance,  or  a
      duly  designated  representative,  upon  his  or  her  request, not more
      frequently than once in each calendar year at a time agreed upon by  the
      state  comptroller, to audit the accuracy of the payments, distributions
      and remittances to the city; and  for  such  other  matters  as  may  be
      necessary  and proper to effectuate the purposes of such agreement. Such
      agreement shall have the force and effect of a rule or regulation of the
      commissioner of motor vehicles and  shall  be  filed  and  published  in
      accordance with any statutory requirements relating thereto.
        l.  The  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  shall  promptly notify the
      corporation counsel of the city of  any  litigation  instituted  against
      such  commissioner which challenges the constitutionality or validity of
      any provision of this chapter, or of the enabling act pursuant to  which
      it  was  adopted, or which attempts to limit or question the application
      of either such law, and such notification shall include  copies  of  the
      papers served upon such commissioner.
        m.  The commissioner of motor vehicles shall begin to collect taxes in
      accordance with the provisions of  this  section  at  such  time  as  is
      specified  in  the  agreement between the commissioner of motor vehicles
      and the commissioner of finance provided for in subdivision  k  of  this
      section.
        n.  In  addition  to  any  other powers granted to the commissioner of
      motor vehicles in this chapter or any other law, he  or  she  is  hereby
      authorized and empowered:
        1.  to adopt and amend rules appropriate to the carrying out of his or
      her responsibilities under this chapter;
    
        2. to  request  information  concerning  motor  vehicles  and  persons
      subject  to  the provisions of this chapter from the department of motor
      vehicles of any other state,  the  treasury  department  of  the  United
      States  or  the appropriate officials of any city or county of the state
      of  New York; and to afford such information to such department of motor
      vehicles, treasury department or officials of such city or  county,  any
      provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding;
        3.  to  delegate  his  or her functions under this section to a deputy
      commissioner in the department of motor vehicles or any employee of such
      department or to any county clerk or other officer who acts as the agent
      of such commissioner in the registration of motor vehicles;
        4. to require all persons owning motor vehicles with respect to  which
      the  tax imposed by this chapter is payable to the commissioner of motor
      vehicles to keep such records as he or she may prescribe and to  furnish
      such information upon his or her request; and
        5. to extend, for cause shown, the time for filing any return required
      to  be  filed  with  the commissioner of motor vehicles for a period not
      exceeding sixty days.
        o. To the extent that any provision of this  section  is  in  conflict
      with any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section
      shall be controlling, but in all other respects such other provisions of
      this   chapter  shall  remain  fully  applicable  with  respect  to  the
      imposition, administration and collection of the taxes imposed  by  this
      chapter.

        §  11-809.2  Collection of tax by the taxi and limousine commission on
      behalf of the commissioner of finance.  a. Notwithstanding any provision
      of this chapter to the contrary, the tax imposed by this chapter on  any
      designated  licensed  vehicle,  as defined in this subdivision, shall be
      collected by  the  taxi  and  limousine  commission  on  behalf  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance. Except as otherwise provided by subdivision m
      of this section, the owner of  each  such  designated  licensed  vehicle
      shall pay the tax due thereon to the taxi and limousine commission on or
      before  the date upon which such owner licenses or renews the license of
      such designated licensed vehicle or is required to license or renew  the
      license  thereof pursuant to chapter five of title nineteen of the code.
      For purposes of this section, the  term  "designated  licensed  vehicle"
      shall  mean  a motor vehicle for the transportation of passengers, other
      than a medallion taxicab, the tax on  which  is  not  collected  by  the
      commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  pursuant  to section 11-809.1 of this
      chapter and which is licensed or required to be licensed by the taxi and
      limousine commission pursuant to any provision of chapter five of  title
      nineteen of the code.
        b.  Notwithstanding any provision of chapter five of title nineteen of
      the code to  the  contrary,  payment  of  the  tax  with  respect  to  a
      designated  licensed  vehicle  shall  be  a  condition  precedent to the
      licensing or license renewal of such designated  licensed  vehicle  with
      the  taxi  and  limousine  commission,  and  no  such license or renewal
      thereof shall be issued  unless  such  tax  has  been  paid.  Except  as
      provided  in subdivisions f and m of this section, if the license period
      applicable to any such designated licensed vehicle is a period  of  more
      than  one  year,  the  tax  required to be paid pursuant to this section
      shall be the annual tax specified in  section  11-802  of  this  chapter
      multiplied  by  the  number of years in the license period. The taxi and
      limousine commission, upon payment of the tax pursuant to  this  section
      or upon the application of any person exempt therefrom, shall furnish to
      each  taxpayer  paying  the tax a receipt for such tax and to each other
      taxpayer or exempt person a statement, document or other form prescribed
      by the taxi and limousine commission, showing that  such  tax  has  been
      paid or is not due with respect to such designated licensed vehicle.
        c.  For purposes of this section, the term "tax period" shall mean the
      license period applicable  to  the  designated  licensed  vehicle  under
      chapter five of title nineteen of the code and, in the case of a license
      period  of  other  than  one year, shall mean the number of twelve-month
      periods and any period of less than twelve months  within  such  license
      period.  The  term "tax period" shall also include any periods described
      in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision m of this section.
        d. Except as provided in subdivision m of this section, where the  tax
      imposed  by  this  chapter  has been paid to the commissioner of finance
      with respect to a motor vehicle for a tax year described in  subdivision
      fourteen  of  section 11-801 of this chapter, and subsequent thereto but
      within such tax year the same taxpayer  pays  a  tax  to  the  taxi  and
      limousine commission with respect to such motor vehicle pursuant to this
      section,  such taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund or credit from the
      commissioner of  finance  for  the  portion  of  the  tax  paid  to  the
      commissioner  of finance that is attributable to the period beginning on
      the first day of the first tax period for which the tax is paid  to  the
      taxi   and   limousine  commission  and  ending  on  the  following  May
      thirty-first, provided, however, that no such refund or credit shall  be
      allowed  if  the amount thereof is less than five dollars. Any refund or
      credit to which a taxpayer is  entitled  pursuant  to  this  subdivision
      shall  be  promptly  refunded  or  credited,  without  interest,  by the
      commissioner of finance, and the commissioner of finance may  promulgate
    
      such  rules  as he or she deems necessary to carry out the provisions of
      this subdivision.
        e.  If the license for the designated licensed vehicle is transferred,
      surrendered or terminated for reasons other  than  revocation,  and  the
      applicable  license  period  under chapter five of title nineteen of the
      code is for more than one year,  and  the  tax  paid  to  the  taxi  and
      limousine  commission  was  for a tax period of more than twelve months,
      except as otherwise provided in  the  agreement  between  the  taxi  and
      limousine commission and the commissioner of finance authorized pursuant
      to  subdivision  k  of  this  section, the commissioner of finance shall
      refund the tax paid for any twelve-month period commencing subsequent to
      the transfer, surrender or other termination of the license described in
      this subdivision.
        f. Except as provided in subdivision m of this section, for designated
      licensed vehicles whose license period is a two year period that  begins
      and  ends  on  the same dates, the tax payable to the taxi and limousine
      commission pursuant  to  this  section  with  respect  to  a  designated
      licensed  vehicle  that is licensed or required to be licensed after the
      commencement of such license period shall be determined as follows:
        1. If such designated licensed vehicle is licensed or required  to  be
      licensed  before  the first day of the seventh month of such period, the
      tax shall be the amount determined pursuant to  subdivision  b  of  this
      section.
        2.  If  such designated licensed vehicle is licensed or required to be
      licensed on or after the first day of the seventh month of  such  period
      but before the first day of the thirteenth month of such period, the tax
      shall  be three-fourths of the amount determined pursuant to subdivision
      b of this section.
        3. If such designated licensed vehicle is licensed or required  to  be
      licensed  on  or  after the first day of the thirteenth month but before
      the first day of the nineteenth month of such period, the tax  shall  be
      one-half  of  the  amount  determined  pursuant to subdivision b of this
      section.
        4. If such designated licensed vehicle is licensed or required  to  be
      licensed  on  or  after  the  first  day of the nineteenth month of such
      period, the tax shall be one-fourth of the amount determined pursuant to
      subdivision b of this section.
        5. When the license period described in this section is for  a  period
      of  less  than  two  years,  the  commissioner of finance shall have the
      authority to provide by  rule  the  amount  to  be  payable  under  this
      subdivision.
        g.  The  provisions of subdivision b of section 11-808 of this chapter
      shall apply to this section with such modifications  or  adaptations  as
      are  necessary  to  carry out the purposes of this section and to ensure
      collection of the appropriate annual tax specified in subdivision  a  of
      section  11-802  of  this chapter, and with due regard to the respective
      responsibilities of  the  commissioner  of  finance  and  the  taxi  and
      limousine  commission  under  this section and to the definition of "tax
      year" contained in  subdivision  fourteen  of  section  11-801  of  this
      chapter and to the definition of "tax period" contained in subdivision c
      of  this  section. The agreement between the commissioner of finance and
      the taxi and limousine commission authorized by subdivision  k  of  this
      section   may   contain  such  provisions  concerning  the  division  of
      responsibility for collection of the taxes imposed by this  chapter  and
      the  granting  of refunds or credits as are consistent with this section
      and  subdivision  b  of  section  11-808  of  this  chapter,   and   the
      commissioner  of  finance and the taxi and limousine commission may also
      adopt such rules as they deem necessary for such purposes.
    
        h. Notwithstanding any provision of section 11-807 of this chapter  to
      the  contrary,  at the time a tax is required to be paid to the taxi and
      limousine commission pursuant to this section, the  person  required  to
      pay  such tax shall file a return with the taxi and limousine commission
      in  such  form and containing such information as the taxi and limousine
      commission may prescribe. The taxpayer's application for  a  license  or
      the  renewal  thereof  shall  constitute  the return required under this
      subdivision unless the taxi and  limousine  commission  shall  otherwise
      provide  by  rule.  A  return  filed  pursuant  to this subdivision with
      respect to a designated licensed vehicle for a  tax  period  or  periods
      shall  be  in  lieu  of  any  return otherwise required to be filed with
      respect thereto pursuant to section 11-807 of this chapter.  Unless  the
      taxi and limousine commission otherwise requires, the filing of a return
      shall  not be required for the tax periods described in subparagraph (A)
      of paragraph one of subdivision m of this section.
        i. In any case in which the tax imposed by this chapter is required to
      be paid to the taxi and limousine commission but is  not  so  paid,  the
      commissioner of finance shall collect such tax and all of the provisions
      of  this  chapter relating to collection of taxes by the commissioner of
      finance shall apply with respect thereto.
        j. Notwithstanding any provision of chapter five of title nineteen  of
      the  code  to  the contrary, in those cases in which the commissioner of
      finance is responsible for collecting the tax imposed by  this  chapter,
      the taxi and limousine commission shall not issue or renew a license for
      any  designated  licensed  vehicle  subject  to such tax with respect to
      which the commissioner of finance has notified the  taxi  and  limousine
      commission  that  such  tax  has not been paid, unless the applicant for
      such license or renewal submits proof, in a form approved  by  the  taxi
      and  limousine  commission,  that such tax has been paid, or is not due,
      with respect to such designated licensed vehicle.
        k. The commissioner of finance is hereby authorized and  empowered  to
      enter into an agreement with the taxi and limousine commission to govern
      the  collection  of the taxes imposed by this chapter which are required
      to be paid to  the  taxi  and  limousine  commission  pursuant  to  this
      section.  Such  agreement  may  provide  for  the  exclusive  method  of
      collection, custody and remittal to the commissioner of finance  of  the
      proceeds of any such tax; for the payment by the commissioner of finance
      of  reasonable expenses incurred by the taxi and limousine commission in
      connection with the collection of any such tax; for the commissioner  of
      finance,  or  a duly designated representative, upon his or her request,
      not more frequently than once in each calendar year  at  a  time  agreed
      upon  by  the  city  comptroller, to audit the accuracy of the payments,
      distributions and remittances to the commissioner of  finance;  and  for
      such  other  matters  as  may  be necessary and proper to effectuate the
      purposes of such agreement.
        l. The  taxi  and  limousine  commission  shall  promptly  notify  the
      corporation  counsel  of the city and the commissioner of finance of any
      litigation instituted  against  such  commission  which  challenges  the
      constitutionality or validity of any provision of this chapter, or which
      attempts  to limit or question the application of this chapter, and such
      notification shall  include  copies  of  the  papers  served  upon  such
      commission.
        m.  Except as otherwise provided in the agreement between the taxi and
      limousine commission and  the  commissioner  of  finance  authorized  by
      subdivision  k of this section, or with respect to the periods described
      in paragraph two of this subdivision, the taxi and limousine  commission
      shall  begin  to collect taxes in accordance with the provisions of this
    
      section on the first day of April in the year  two  thousand  twelve  as
      follows:
        1. The tax due on a designated licensed vehicle, the license for which
      expires  on  or  after  the  first  day of June in the year two thousand
      twelve and before the first  day  of  June  in  the  year  two  thousand
      fourteen, shall be determined as follows:
        (A)  For  a  designated  licensed  vehicle whose license expires on or
      after the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve  and  before
      the  first  day of June in the year two thousand fourteen, the amount of
      tax for the tax period between the first day of June  in  the  year  two
      thousand  twelve  and  the  date  the  license  shall  expire  for  such
      designated licensed vehicle pursuant to chapter five of  title  nineteen
      of  the  code  shall  be  the  sum  of  (i)  the annual tax specified in
      subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802  of
      this  chapter  for  any  twelve-month period within such tax period, and
      (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph  for
      any period of less than twelve months within such tax period. The amount
      of tax so determined shall be payable on or before the first day of June
      in  the year two thousand twelve. In the event the amount of tax due and
      payable under this subparagraph shall not have been paid  within  thirty
      days  of the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve, the taxi
      and limousine commission shall suspend the license for  such  designated
      licensed  vehicle,  and  the  license  for  any such designated licensed
      vehicle which has expired shall not be renewed until such time  as  such
      tax is paid.
        (B)  For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of
      tax for a period of less than  twelve  months  shall  be  determined  as
      follows:  (i) if such period is nine months or more, the amount for such
      period shall be the full amount of annual tax provided  in  subparagraph
      (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter;
      (ii)  if  such period is more than six months but less than nine months,
      the amount for such period shall  be  three-fourths  of  the  amount  of
      annual  tax provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision
      a of section 11-802 of this chapter; (iii) if such period is  more  than
      three  months but less than six months, the amount for such period shall
      be one-half of the amount of annual tax provided in subparagraph (C)  of
      paragraph  two  of  subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter; and
      (iv) if such period is less than  three  months,  the  amount  for  such
      period  shall  be  one-fourth  of  the  amount of annual tax provided in
      subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802  of
      this chapter.
        2.  Upon  the  date  for  payment  set  forth  in  subparagraph (A) of
      paragraph one of this subdivision, the  taxi  and  limousine  commission
      shall  require  the taxpayer to provide a proof of payment of the tax to
      the commissioner of finance for the period beginning on the first day of
      June in the year two thousand eleven and ending on the thirty-first  day
      of  May  in  the year two thousand twelve or any part of such period for
      which the taxpayer was subject to the tax. In the event the taxpayer has
      not paid such tax to the commissioner of finance: (i)  the  license  for
      any  designated  licensed  vehicle described in subparagraph (A) of this
      paragraph shall not be renewed until such time  as  such  tax,  together
      with  any  applicable  interest  or  penalties,  has  been  paid  to the
      commissioner of finance and (ii) if such tax remains unpaid  as  of  the
      end  of the thirty-day period set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph
      one of this subdivision, the license for any designated licensed vehicle
      described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of this subdivision shall
      be suspended until such time as such tax, together with  any  applicable
      interest or penalties, is paid to the commissioner of finance.
    
        n.  In  addition to any other powers granted to the taxi and limousine
      commission in this chapter or any other  law,  the  taxi  and  limousine
      commission is hereby authorized and empowered:
        1.  to  adopt  and  amend rules appropriate to the carrying out of its
      responsibilities under this chapter;
        2. to  request  information  concerning  motor  vehicles  and  persons
      subject to the provisions of this chapter from the commissioner of motor
      vehicles,  the  department  of  motor  vehicles  of any other state, the
      treasury department of the United States or the appropriate officials of
      any city or county of  the  state  of  New  York;  and  to  afford  such
      information to such department of motor vehicles, treasury department or
      officials  of  such city or county, any provision of this chapter to the
      contrary notwithstanding;
        3. to delegate its functions under this section to any commissioner or
      employee of such commission;
        4. to require any person who is an owner, as defined in  chapter  five
      of  title nineteen of the code, of a designated licensed vehicle to keep
      such records as it prescribes and to furnish such information  upon  its
      request; and
        5. to extend, for cause shown, the time for filing any return required
      to  be  filed  with  the  taxi and limousine commission for a period not
      exceeding sixty days.
        o. To the extent that any provision of this  section  is  in  conflict
      with any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section
      shall be controlling, but in all other respects such other provisions of
      this   chapter  shall  remain  fully  applicable  with  respect  to  the
      imposition, administration and collection of the taxes imposed  by  this
      chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-810

Section 11-810 ::    
        
     
        § 11-810 Determination of tax. If a return required by this chapter is
      not  filed,  or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the
      commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from  such
      information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
      on the basis of external indices such as motor vehicle registration with
      the  department  of  motor  vehicles and/or any other factors. Notice of
      such determination shall be given to the person liable for  the  payment
      of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax
      unless  the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after
      the giving of notice of such determination or, if  the  commissioner  of
      finance  has  established  a  conciliation procedure pursuant to section
      11-124 of the  code  and  the  taxpayer  has  requested  a  conciliation
      conference  in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing
      of  a  conciliation  decision  or  the  date   of   the   commissioner's
      confirmation  of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both
      (i) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2)  files  a
      petition  with  the  tax  appeals  tribunal for a hearing, or unless the
      commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall  redetermine  the
      same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc  from  the  decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through  one
      hundred  seventy-two  of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals
      tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the  person  against  whom
      the  tax  is  assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of
      the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for  error,
      illegality  or  unconstitutionality  or any other reason whatsoever by a
      proceeding under article seventy-eight of the  civil  practice  law  and
      rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person
      against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of
      the  notice  of  such  tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under
      article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
      instituted  by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be
      reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any,  shall  be  first
      deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with
      the  commissioner  of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company
      authorized to transact business  in  this  state  and  approved  by  the
      superintendent   of   insurance   of  this  state  as  to  solvency  and
      responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as  a  justice  of
      the  supreme  court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding
      be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all  costs  and
      charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at
      the  option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner
      of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties  and
      interest  thereon  stated  in  such  decision plus the costs and charges
      which may accrue against it in the prosecution  of  the  proceeding,  in
      which  event  the  taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes,
      penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-811
--------------

Section 11-811 ::    
        
     
        §  11-811  Refunds.  a.  In  the  manner  provided in this section the
      commissioner of finance shall refund or credit,  without  interest,  any
      tax,  penalty  or  interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally
      collected or paid, if written application to the commissioner of finance
      for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment  thereof.
      Whenever  a  refund  or  credit  is  made or denied, the commissioner of
      finance shall state his or her reason therefor and give  notice  thereof
      to  the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of
      any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor  on  payments  due
      from the applicant.
        b.  Any  determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund
      or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be  final  and
      irrevocable  unless  the  applicant  for  such  refund or credit, within
      ninety days from the mailing or notice of such determination, or, if the
      commissioner  of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation   procedure
      pursuant   to   section   11-124  and  the  applicant  has  requested  a
      conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from
      the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's
      confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding,  both
      (1)  serves  a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a
      petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition  for
      a  refund  or  credit,  made  as  herein  provided,  shall  be deemed an
      application for a revision of any tax, penalty  or  interest  complained
      of.  Such  hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en
      banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall  be  conducted  in
      the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals
      tribunal  pursuant  to  sections  one  hundred  sixty-eight  through one
      hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax  appeals
      tribunal  shall  give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the
      commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute  a
      proceeding  pursuant  to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law
      and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals  tribunal  sitting  en
      banc  if  application  to the supreme court be made therefor within four
      months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the
      case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of  tax
      due  was  not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted
      by a taxpayer, unless an undertaking  shall  first  be  filed  with  the
      commissioner  of  finance  in  such  amount  and with such sureties as a
      justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that  if  such
      proceeding  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all
      costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.
        c. A person shall not be entitled to  a  revision,  refund  or  credit
      under  this  section  of  a  tax,  interest  or  penalty  which had been
      determined to be due pursuant to the provisions  of  section  11-810  of
      this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a
      hearing,  as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or
      herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit  shall  be
      made  of  a  tax,  interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
      commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-810 of this  chapter
      unless  it  be  found  that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
      unconstitutional or otherwise improper,  by  the  tax  appeals  tribunal
      after  a  hearing  or  on the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax
      appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the  determination  of  the
      commissioner  of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of
      the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  said
      section,  in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made
      of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-812
--------------

Section 11-812 ::    
        
     
        §  11-812  Remedies  exclusive.  The remedies provided by this chapter
      shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for  the  review
      of  tax  liability  imposed  by  this  chapter;  and no determination or
      proposed determination of tax or determination on  any  application  for
      refund  by  the  commissioner  of  finance,  nor any decision by the tax
      appeals tribunal or any of  its  administrative  law  judges,  shall  be
      enjoined  or  reviewed  by an action for declaratory judgment, an action
      for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in
      the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting  en  banc,  a
      proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
      rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer  may  proceed  by  declaratory
      judgment  if  the  taxpayer  institutes  suit within thirty days after a
      deficiency assessment is made and pays  the  amount  of  the  deficiency
      assessment  to  the  commissioner of finance prior to the institution of
      such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in  section  11-810  of
      this chapter.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-813
--------------

Section 11-813 ::    
        
     
        §  11-813  Reserves.  In  cases  where  the taxpayer has applied for a
      refund and has instituted a proceeding under  article  seventy-eight  of
      the  civil  practice  law and rules to review a determination adverse to
      the taxpayer on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall
      set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 11-814
--------------

Section 11-814 ::    
        
     
        § 11-814 Proceedings to recover tax. a. Whenever any person shall fail
      to  pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein
      provided, the  corporation  counsel  shall,  upon  the  request  of  the
      commissioner  of  finance,  bring  or  cause  to be brought an action to
      enforce payment of the same against the person liable for  the  same  on
      behalf  of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or
      of  any  other  state  or  of  the  United  States.  If,  however,   the
      commissioner  of  finance  in  his  or  her  discretion  believes that a
      taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter  is  about  to  cease
      business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which
      tax  or  penalties  might  be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty
      will not be paid when due, the commissioner  may  declare  such  tax  or
      penalty  to  be  immediately  due  and  payable  and may issue a warrant
      immediately.
        b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner  of  finance
      may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff
      to  levy  upon  and  sell  the real and personal property of such person
      which may be found within the  city,  for  the  payment  of  the  amount
      thereof,  with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the
      warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of  finance  and
      to  pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within
      sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The  city  sheriff  shall,
      within  five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the county
      clerk a copy thereof, and  thereupon  such  clerk  shall  enter  in  the
      judgement docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the
      amount  of  the  tax,  penalties  and  interest for which the warrant is
      issued and the date when such copy is filed.  Thereupon  the  amount  of
      such  warrant  so  docketed  shall  become  a lien upon the title to and
      interest in real and personal property of the person  against  whom  the
      warrant  is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant
      in the same manner and with like effect  as  that  provided  by  law  in
      respect  to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court
      of record, and for services in executing the warrant the  sheriff  shall
      be  entitled  to  the  same fees which he or she may collect in the same
      manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance  a  warrant  of
      like  terms,  force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer
      or employee of the department of finance, and in the  execution  thereof
      such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon
      sheriffs,  but  such  officer or employee shall be entitled to no fee or
      compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
      such duty.  If  a  warrant  is  returned  not  satisfied  in  full,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may  from time to time issue new warrants and
      shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount  due  thereunder
      as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had
      been returned unsatisfied.
        c.  Whenever  there  is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of
      any part or the whole of a stock  of  merchandise  or  of  fixtures,  or
      merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business
      of  the  seller,  transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary
      course of trade and in the regular prosecution  of  said  business,  the
      purchaser,  transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking
      possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise  and  fixtures,
      or  paying  therefor,  notify  the commissioner of finance by registered
      mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof
      whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has  represented  to,
      or  informed  the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax
      pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or
    
      assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether  any  such
      taxes are in fact owing.
        Whenever  the  purchaser,  transferee  or  assignee shall fail to give
      notice to the commissioner of  finance  as  required  by  the  preceding
      paragraph,  or  whenever  the  commissioner  of finance shall inform the
      purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax  or
      taxes  exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other
      consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee  is  required
      to  transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject
      to a first priority right and lien for any  such  taxes  theretofore  or
      thereafter  determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor
      to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is  forbidden  to
      transfer  to  the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money,
      property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of  the  city's
      claim.  For  failure  to comply with the provisions of this subdivision,
      the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being  subject  to
      the  liabilities  and  remedies  imposed under the provisions of section
      forty-four of the personal property law, shall be personally liable  for
      the  payment  to  the  city  of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter
      determined to be  due  to  the  city  from  the  seller,  transferor  or
      assignor,  and  such  liability may be assessed and enforced in the same
      manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.
        d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the  interests
      of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as
      the  commissioner  of finance may require, may release any property from
      the lien of any  warrant  or  vacate  such  warrant  for  unpaid  taxes,

Section 11-817 ::    
        
     
        § 11-817 Interest and penalties. (a) Interest on underpayments. If any
      amount  of  tax  is  not  paid on or before the last date prescribed for
      payment (without regard to any extension of time granted  for  payment),
      interest  on  such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance
      pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is  set,  at
      the  rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the
      period from such last date to the date  of  payment.  In  computing  the
      amount  of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily.
      Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount  thereof
      is less than one dollar.
        (b)  * (1)  Failure  to  file return. (A) In case of failure to file a
      return under this chapter on or before the prescribed  date  (determined
      with  regard  to  any  extension of time for filing), unless it is shown
      that such failure is due to reasonable cause  and  not  due  to  willful
      neglect,  there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax
      on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure  is
      for  not  more  than one month, with an additional five percent for each
      additional  month  or  fraction  thereof  during  which   such   failure
      continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.
        (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
      of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
      to  any  extension  of  time  for  filing), unless it is shown that such
      failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect,  the
      addition  to  tax  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be
      less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one  hundred  percent  of
      the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
        (C)  For  purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be
      shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
      tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
      tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
      upon the return.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay  the
      amount  shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter
      on or  before  the  prescribed  date  (determined  with  regard  to  any
      extension  of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is
      due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there  shall  be
      added  to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent
      of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
      with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month  or
      fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
      twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the
      addition  for  any  month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be
      reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or  before
      the  beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the
      tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax  required
      to  be  shown  on  a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such
      return, this paragraph shall  be  applied  by  substituting  such  lower
      amount.
        (3)  Failure  to  pay  tax  required to be shown on return. In case of
      failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown  on
      a  return  required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown
      (including a determination made  pursuant  to  section  11-810  of  this
      chapter)  within  ten  days of the date of a notice and demand therefor,
      unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and  not
      due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated
      in  such  notice  and  demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the
      failure is not for more than one month, with an additional  one-half  of
    
      one  percent  for each additional month or fraction thereof during which
      such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding  twenty-five  percent  in  the
      aggregate.  For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the
      amount  of  tax  stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the
      amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such
      month.
        * (4) Limitations on additions.
        (A) With respect to any return,  the  amount  of  the  addition  under
      paragraph  one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the
      addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to  which
      an  addition  applies  under  both  paragraphs  one and two. In any case
      described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision,  the
      amount  of  the  addition  under such paragraph one shall not be reduced
      below the amount provided in such subparagraph.
        (B) With respect to any return, the maximum  amount  of  the  addition
      permitted  under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by
      the amount of the addition  under  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision
      (determined  without  regard  to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one)
      which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made
      and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (c)  Underpayment  due  to  negligence.  (1)  If  any  part  of   an
      underpayment  of  tax  is  due to negligence or intentional disregard of
      this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but  without  intent
      to  defraud),  there  shall  be added to the tax a penalty equal to five
      percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such  paragraph  one  which  is  attributable  to  the   negligence   or
      intentional  disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period
      beginning on the last  date  prescribed  by  law  for  payment  of  such
      underpayment  (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on
      the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date  of  the
      payment of the tax).
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        * (d) Underpayment due to fraud. (1) If any part of an underpayment of
      tax  is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to
      fifty percent of the underpayment.
        (2) There shall be added to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  penalty
      determined  under  paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to
      fifty percent of the interest payable  under  subdivision  (a)  of  this
      section  with  respect  to  the portion of the underpayment described in
      such paragraph one which  is  attributable  to  fraud,  for  the  period
      beginning  on  the  last  day  prescribed  by  law  for  payment of such
      underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
      the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
      payment of the tax).
        (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of  any  other
      addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.
        * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 51, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14
        (e)  Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
      fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or
      certify any return,  or  to  supply  any  information  within  the  time
      required  by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not
      more than one  thousand  dollars,  in  addition  to  any  other  amounts
      required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the
    
      commissioner  of  finance.  The  commissioner  of finance shall have the
      power, in his or her discretion, to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any
      penalty under this subdivision.
        (f)  The  interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid
      and disposed  of  in  the  same  manner  as  other  revenues  from  this
      subchapter.    Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same
      manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.
        (g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner  of  finance
      shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be
      deemed  to  be  set  at  seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate
      shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of  this  subdivision  but
      shall  not  be  less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such
      rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply  to  taxes,  or  any
      portion  thereof,  which  remain  or  become due on or after the date on
      which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with  respect  to
      interest  computed  or  computable  for  periods  or portions of periods
      occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.
        (2) General rule. The rate of  interest  set  under  this  subdivision
      shall  be  the  sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under
      paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.
        (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:
        (A) The federal short-term rate for any month  shall  be  the  federal
      short-term  rate  determined  by  the  United  States  secretary  of the
      treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of  section
      twelve  hundred  seventy-four  of  the  internal revenue code for use in
      connection with section six  thousand  six  hundred  twenty-one  of  the
      internal  revenue  code.  Any  such rate shall be rounded to the nearest
      full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one  percent,  such  rate
      shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
        (B) Period during which rate applies.
        (i)   In   general.   Except  as  provided  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
      subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first  month  in  each
      calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning
      after such month.
        (ii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September,  nineteen hundred
      eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,
      nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  shall  apply with respect to setting the
      rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
      eighty-nine.
        (4)  Publication  of  interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall
      cause to be published in the city record,  and  give  other  appropriate
      general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no
      later  than  twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter
      during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication  of
      such  interest  rate  shall  not  be  included  within  paragraph (a) of
      subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the  city  charter
      relating to the definition of a rule.
        * (h)  Miscellaneous.  (1)  The  certificate  of  the  commissioner of
      finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a motor vehicle
      has not be registered, that  a  return  has  not  been  filed,  or  that
      information  has  not  been  supplied pursuant to the provisions of this
      chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.

      any registration or return filed hereunder is furnished, or to whom  any
      information  contained  in any registration or return filed hereunder is
      furnished, to divulge or  make  known  in  any  manner  any  information
      relating to or contained in any registration or any kind of return filed

      person filing the return, whether such person files the return on his or
      her own behalf or on behalf of another, or to the person on whose behalf
      the return is filed; nor to prohibit the commissioner  of  finance  from
      providing  by rule for the display or production of any original return,
      as an indicium of payment of the tax imposed by  this  chapter;  nor  to
      prohibit  the  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
      identification of particular registrations and  returns  and  the  items
      thereof;  nor  to  prohibit  the  delivery  of  a  certified copy of any
      registration or return to the United States of America or any department

      state  of  New  York or other legal representatives of the department of
      motor vehicles, or by the district attorney of  any  county  within  the
      city  of the registration or return of any person who shall bring action
      to set aside or review any tax hereunder, or against whom an  action  or
      proceeding  under  this chapter is instituted. Returns, or reproductions
      thereof, pertaining to any motor vehicle registered hereunder  shall  be
      preserved  for  three  years  and  thereafter  until the commissioner of
      finance or the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles  permits  them  to  be
      destroyed.

        §  11-819 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or
      required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person
      for whom it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid  envelope  addressed
      to  such person at the address given in the last registration of a motor
      vehicle filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
      or in any application made by such person, or if  no  such  registration
      has  been  filed  or  application  made,  then to such address as may be
      obtainable. The mailing of a notice as in this subdivision provided  for
      shall  be  presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person
      to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined  according  to
      the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to
      run  from  the  date  of  mailing  of such notice as in this subdivision
      provided.

      relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of  a  civil  remedy
      shall  not  apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy,
      appraise, assess, determine or enforce the  collection  of  any  tax  or
      penalty  provided  by  this  chapter.  However,  except in the case of a
      wilfully false or fraudulent registration or return with intent to evade
      the tax, no assessment  of  additional  tax  shall  be  made  after  the
      expiration  of  more  than  three  years  from  the date of such return;
      provided, however, that where no registration or no return has been made
      as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.
        c. Where before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the
      assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing  that
      such  period  be  extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be
      determined at any time  within  such  extended  period.  The  period  so
      extended  may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made
      before the expiration of the extended period.
        d. If any return, claim,  statement,  notice,  application,  or  other
      document  required  to  be  filed,  or  any payment required to be made,
      within a prescribed period or on  or  before  a  prescribed  date  under
      authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such
      date,  delivered  by  United States mail to the commissioner of finance,
      commissioner of  motor  vehicles,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal,  bureau,
      office,  officer  or  person  with  which  or with whom such document is
      required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to
      be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the  envelope
      shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply
      only  if  the  postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or
      before the prescribed date for the  filing  of  such  document,  or  for
      making  the  payment, including any extension granted for such filing or
      payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail,
      postage prepaid, properly addressed  to  the  commissioner  of  finance,
      commissioner  of  motor  vehicles,  the  tax  appeals  tribunal, bureau,
      office, officer or person with  which  or  with  whom  the  document  is
      required  to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to
      be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail,  such
      registration  shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  that  such document was
      delivered  to  the  commissioner  of  finance,  commissioner  of   motor
      vehicles, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to
      which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed
      the  postmark  date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the
      tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation  the  extent
      to  which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima
      facie evidence  of  delivery  and  the  postmark  date  shall  apply  to
      certified  mail.  Except  as  provided in subdivision f of this section,
      this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not  made  by  the
    
      United  States postal service only if and to the extent provided by rule
      of the commissioner of finance  or,  where  relevant,  the  tax  appeals
      tribunal.
        e.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this chapter
      (including any extension of time) for performing  any  act  falls  on  a
      Saturday,  Sunday  or  legal  holiday  in  the  state  of  New York, the
      performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on
      the next succeeding day  which  is  not  a  Saturday,  Sunday  or  legal
      holiday.
        f.  (1)  Any  reference in subdivision d of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
      pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
      code and any reference in subdivision d of  this  section  to  a  United
      States  postmark  shall  be treated as including a reference to any date
      recorded or marked in  the  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five
      hundred  two  of  the  internal  revenue  code  by a designated delivery
      service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery  service
      designated  by  such  secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city,
      the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation  for  purposes
      of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional
      delivery  services  meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code for purposes  of  this  title,  or  may
      withdraw  any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that
      a delivery service so designated is inadequate  for  the  needs  of  the
      city.  Any  reference  in  subdivision  d  of this section to the United
      States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
      service  designated  by the commissioner of finance and any reference in
      subdivision d of this section to  a  United  States  postmark  shall  be
      treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
      manner described in section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the  internal
      revenue  code  by  a  delivery service designated by the commissioner of
      finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or
      additional designation by the  commissioner  of  finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
        (2)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
      United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
      commissioner  of  finance  pursuant  to  the  same criteria used by such
      secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred
      two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within  the  meaning
      of  registered  or  certified  mail  as  used  in  subdivision d of this
      section. If the commissioner of finance finds  that  any  equivalent  of
      registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
      commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs  of  the  city,  the
      commissioner  of  finance  may withdraw such designation for purposes of
      this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation
      or additional designation by the commissioner of finance  shall  not  be
      effective  for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless
      and until such withdrawal of designation or  additional  designation  is
      ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.
