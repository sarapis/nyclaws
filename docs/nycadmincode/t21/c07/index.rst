      engaged   in  an  educational,  training  or  vocational  rehabilitation
      activity  to  any  additional  activity,  the  agency  shall  take   all
      reasonable  steps  to locate an assignment that is either at the site of
      the educational, training or vocational rehabilitation  activity  or  in
      reasonably  close proximity thereto and which does not conflict with the
      hours  during  which  such  individual's   educational,   training   and
      vocational rehabilitation activity takes place.
        h.   The   agency  shall  not  require  any  applicant,  recipient  or

      participating in any approved  program  that  can  be  classified  as  a
      countable  work  activity  to participate in any other activity for more
      than 35 hours or the minimum number of hours  necessary  to  count  such
      applicant, recipient or participant as "engaged in work" for purposes of

      number of hours per week that sections  335-b  and  336  of  the  social
      services law would require for an applicant, participant or recipient to
      be "engaged in work," whichever is greater.
        2.  During the period an individual participates in a postsecondary 2-
      or 4-year degree program under this  subdivision,  the  individual  must
      make  satisfactory  progress  in  the  program or have an undue hardship
      exemption.
        3. For purposes of determining hours per week under subparagraph 1  of
      this subdivision, an applicant, recipient or participant who is a parent
      or guardian of a dependent child will receive one hour of study time for
      every  hour of class time during the first 24 months of participation in
      the postsecondary degree program.

        §  21-704  Notice  of rights and responsibilities. a. The agency shall
      inform  applicants,  recipients  and   participants   of   all   rights,
      entitlements and agency obligations required under this chapter.
        b.  Any  notice  directing  an  applicant, recipient or participant to
      report for an assessment, the development of an employability plan, or a
      work-related assignment, shall contain a description of  the  rights  to
      pursue  education  and training activities as set forth in this chapter,
      and shall contain the following statement:
        "Your Education and Training Rights
        When you come for your appointment, we will tell you about your rights
      to participate in education and training programs. The hours  you  spend
      in   education   and  training  programs  may  count  toward  your  work
      requirement.
        A Master List of Programs
        You have a right to receive the complete "HRA Consolidated Master List
      of Approved Training Programs." This is a list of education and training
      programs you can choose to go to. Hours spent in  any  program  on  that
      list will count toward your work requirement.
        Other Choices for Training and Education
        You  can also go to education or training programs that are not on the
      Consolidated Master List. However, those programs must meet  appropriate
      City or State standards.
        Time To Find the Right Program for You
        If  you  need  to  participate  in an education or training program in
      order to improve your chances of getting a job,  we  must  give  you  15
      business  days  before  your  assessment,  upon your request, to find an
      appropriate education or training program.
        If You Are Already In an Education or Training Program
        If you are already in school we must  allow  you  to  remain  in  your
      program  as long as your program appears on the "HRA Consolidated Master
      List of Approved Training Programs" or meets the City or State standards
      mentioned above.
        Reassessment
        If you are dissatisfied with the work activity to which you have  been
      assigned for six months or more and you believe that you are eligible to
      attend  education or training, you should request a reassessment of your
      employability. If you are found to be eligible to attend a  training  or
      education program, you can switch into an education or training program.
      Again,  your  choice must appear on the "HRA Consolidated Master List of
      Approved Training Programs" or meet appropriate City or State standards.
      If you are already in a work activity, you do not have a 15 business day
      period to find an education or training program. In this case, you  must
      continue  in  your  work  activity  while  you  look for an education or
      training program.
        Your Right to a Fair Hearing
        The agency must give you a copy of your employability plan. You have a
      right to a fair hearing to challenge your assignment."
