Section 21-502 ::    
        
     
        * § 21-502 Transitional jobs program.
        a. The mayor shall direct the commissioner to establish a transitional
      jobs  program,  which  shall  consist  of  a  total of two thousand five
      hundred temporary jobs in  the  public  sector  and  in  community-based
      organizations,  at  least  two-thirds  of  which shall be created within
      local government agencies in the public sector. Such total number of two
      thousand five hundred  temporary  jobs  shall  exist  for  a  period  of
      thirty-six  months,  commencing  on  January  first,  two  thousand one;
      provided, however,  that  each  participant  in  the  transitional  jobs
      program   shall   only   be  employed  by  a  sponsoring  or  affiliated
      organization for a period not to exceed twelve  months,  and  that  each
      specific  job created pursuant to the transitional jobs program shall be
      retained for at least twelve months. An initial group  of  two  thousand
      five  hundred  participants  shall commence employment on January first,
      two  thousand  one.  A  second  group  of  two  thousand  five   hundred
      participants  shall  commence  employment on January first, two thousand
      two, and a final group of two thousand five hundred  participants  shall
      commence employment on January first, two thousand three.
        b.  The  jobs  created  in  local government agencies pursuant to this
      chapter shall, consistent with applicable collective bargaining laws and
      agreements, be accreted to appropriate  existing  collective  bargaining
      units.
        c.  In  implementing  the  transitional  jobs program, the mayor shall
      direct the commissioner to select which local government agencies  shall
      be   sponsoring   organizations.   In  making  such  determination,  the
      commissioner may work in cooperation with  the  commissioners  of  other
      local  government  agencies  and  may, consistent with obligations under
      collective bargaining laws and agreements, consult  with  the  heads  of
      collective  bargaining  organizations, and may consider each prospective
      agency's prior experience hiring welfare recipients and the  unemployed,
      its  prior  experience  assisting  such individuals in finding jobs, its
      prior experience providing education and  training,  career  counseling,
      and  related  services to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill
      the needs of communities throughout the city of New York, its  plans  to
      employ  or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans
      to provide case management to participants, and its plans to  assist  in
      the permanent placement of participants following their participation in
      the transitional jobs program.
        d.  In  meeting  the  goal  of placing participants in community based
      organizations pursuant  to  this  chapter,  the  mayor  may  direct  the
      commissioner  to  issue  a request for proposals or to utilize any other
      procurement  method  that  he  or  she   deems   necessary   to   select
      community-based  organizations  to  become  sponsoring organizations. To
      determine which community-based organizations  shall  become  sponsoring
      organizations,  the  commissioner  may  consider an organization's prior
      experience hiring welfare  recipients  and  the  unemployed,  its  prior
      experience  assisting  such  individuals  in  finding  jobs,  its  prior
      experience providing education  and  training,  career  counseling,  and
      related  services  to its employees, its plans to address or fulfill the
      needs of communities throughout the city  of  New  York,  its  plans  to
      employ  or facilitate the employment of certified individuals, its plans
      to provide case management to participants, and its plans to  assist  in
      the permanent placement of participants following their participation in
      the  transitional jobs program. Where the employees of a community-based
      organization that has been selected to become a sponsoring or affiliated
      organization  are  members  of  a  collective  bargaining   unit,   such
      collective  bargaining unit shall, consistent with applicable collective
      bargaining laws and agreements, have the opportunity to comment on  such
    
      selection.  The  commissioner  shall  respond  to  such  comments within
      fifteen days of their receipt.
        e. Each sponsoring or affiliated organization may employ any certified
      individual,  and employment with a sponsoring or affiliated organization
      shall be for a period not to exceed twelve months.
        f. The sponsoring organizations shall provide  each  participant  with
      the  necessary  case  management to enable the participant to succeed in
      the transitional jobs program, build his or her job skills, and  enhance
      his  or her chances of securing permanent employment after participating
      in the transitional jobs program.

      requirement,  a participant may not be compensated at a rate of pay that
      is less than that of other employees of  the  sponsoring  or  affiliated
      organization  employing such participant, who are performing the same or
      comparable work.
        c. A participant who is not a member of a collective  bargaining  unit
      shall  be entitled to the same paid holidays and benefits permissible by
      law as other employees of  the  sponsoring  or  affiliated  organization
      employing  such  participant,  who are performing the same or comparable
      work.
        d. A participant who is a  member  of  a  collective  bargaining  unit
      shall,  consistent  with  collective  bargaining  laws  and  agreements,
      receive,  at  a  minimum,  the  salary  and  benefits  provided  for  in
      subdivisions  b,  c  and  e of this section, provided however, that such

      and conditions of employment.
        e. A participant shall work the standard work hours  required  by  the
      sponsoring  or  affiliated  organization which employs such participant,
      except that in no instance shall a participant be required to work  more
      than  forty  hours  per  week.  A  participant  shall  be  excused, when
      necessary, for up to an average of  eight  hours  per  week  from  their

      and job readiness or placement  services.  The  sponsoring  organization
      shall   prepare   the  participant's  work  schedule  and  may  allocate
      additional hours during any work week to be spent  on  adult  education,
      job  training,  and job readiness or placement services, so long as over
      the course of the participant's employment, no more than an  average  of
      eight  hour  per  week  is  allocated to these activities. A participant
      shall be compensated as set forth in subdivision b of this section  when
      such  participant  engages  in  adult  education,  job  training, or job
      readiness and placement services as provided for in this subdivision.
        f. A participant shall be considered an employee for purposes  of  the
      city's  human  rights  and  collective  bargaining  laws  and  any other
      applicable local laws, unless otherwise  prohibited  by  law;  provided,
      however,  that nothing herein shall limit the participant's rights under
      an applicable federal or state law.  In  implementing  the  transitional
      jobs program, the mayor or his or her designee, shall take any necessary
      and/or  appropriate  actions  to classify participants employed by local
      government agencies in accordance with all applicable civil service laws
      and consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

      complaints   by  participants  who  are  not  members  of  a  collective
      bargaining unit. Such grievance procedure shall provide  for  a  hearing

      time,  and  place  of  the  hearing  within five business days after the

      consents  in  writing  to  a  postponement  of  such  hearing. A written
      decision shall be issued within ten business  days  after  the  hearing.
      Nothing  in  this  section  shall be construed to limit the right of any

      bargaining  unit  or  a participant represented by a designated employee
      spokesperson,  from  pursuing  other  available   remedies   under   any
