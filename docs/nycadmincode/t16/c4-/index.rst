        § 16-461 Unlawful removal or sale of material. a. Recyclable material.
      1.  Except  for  an  authorized  employee or agent of the department, it
      shall be unlawful for any  person  to  remove  and  transport  by  motor
      vehicle  any  recyclable  material  that  has  been placed by any owner,
      tenant or occupant of any residential  building,  building  occupied  by
      city  agencies or institutions, or vacant lot, or by their agent, within
      the stoop area, adjacent to the curb line or otherwise adjacent to  such
      building  or  lot for collection or removal by the department. The owner
      of any motor vehicle used in violation of this subdivision shall also be
      liable for any such violation. This paragraph  shall  not  prohibit  any
      person from lawfully entering into a written agreement with the owner of
      a  building,  or  his  or  her  agent, pursuant to subdivision a of this
      section.
        2. i. The owner or agent of  any  building  containing  four  or  more
      residential  units  or any building that is occupied by a city agency or
      institution receiving department  collection,  may  not  enter  into  an
      agreement  for  the  supplemental  collection of recyclable material for
      purposes of transport, handling or management with any person other than
      the department unless (A) regularly scheduled department  collection  of
      recyclable material from such building is insufficient to meet the needs
      of  such  building,  (B)  such owner or agent has requested supplemental
      collection of recyclable material from the department and the department
      has denied the request, and (C) such supplemental collection by a person
      other than the department does  not  take  place  on  the  same  day  as
      regularly  scheduled  department  collection  of recyclable material for
      such building, in which case such owner  or  agent  may  enter  into  an
      agreement  for the supplemental collection of recyclable material with a
      person other than  the  department.  The  department  shall  respond  to
      requests  for  supplemental  collection  of  recyclable  material within
      thirty days of the receipt of such request. If the department  does  not
      respond  within  such  period,  the  department  shall be deemed to have
      denied the request for supplemental collection. The requirements of this
      paragraph shall not apply to recyclable material that is not  designated
      recyclable by the department pursuant to subdivision b of section 16-305
      of  this  title.  In  no  event  may such agreement for the supplemental
      collection  of  recyclable  material  provide   for   the   removal   of
      department-marked items.
        ii.  Nothing  in this section shall be construed to allow the owner or
      agent of any building containing four or more units or any building that
      is occupied  by  a  city  agency  or  institution  receiving  department
      collection  to  enter  into an agreement for recycling collection on the
      same day as regularly  scheduled  department  collection  of  recyclable
      material for any such building.
        iii.   Any  agreement  lawfully  entered  into  for  the  supplemental
      collection of recyclable material pursuant to this  paragraph  shall  be
      written;  signed  and dated by the owner or agent and by or on behalf of
      the person responsible for the  supplemental  collection  of  recyclable
      material;  notarized;  filed  with the commissioner within five business
      days of being signed; and shall include  the  address  of  the  building
      receiving  supplemental  collection;  the  names,  telephone numbers and
      taxpayer  identification  numbers,  including  individual  or   employer
      taxpayer identification numbers, but not social security numbers, of the
      person  responsible  for  the  collection  of  such material; the names,
      titles and telephone numbers of all signatories to such  agreement;  the
      terms  relating  to  price and the days and times of collection, if any;
      the duration of such agreement; the  estimated  quantity  of  recyclable
      material  to  be  collected on a weekly basis; and any other information
      required by the commissioner by rule.
    
        iv.  Any  agreement  lawfully  entered  into  for   the   supplemental
      collection  of  recyclable material pursuant to this paragraph shall not
      exceed two years in duration.
        v.  Valid  proof  of  any  agreement  lawfully  entered  into  for the
      supplemental  collection  of  recyclable  material  pursuant   to   this
      paragraph must be in the possession of the motor vehicle operator at the
      time  such  recyclable  material  is collected. Valid proof shall mean a
      copy of such agreement or a copy of the notarized signatory page of such
      agreement, together with a letter from the department acknowledging  the
      filing  of such agreement with the commissioner. Such proof shall not be
      required where the person responsible for the supplemental collection of
      recyclable material is licensed pursuant to  subdivision  a  of  section
      16-505 of this code.
        3.  On  or before February first and August first of every year, every
      person engaged in the lawful collection of recyclable material  pursuant
      to  a  written  agreement  in  accordance  with  paragraph  two  of this
      subdivision shall submit to the commissioner a  report  identifying  the
      weight  of  each  type  of  recyclable material collected by such person
      during the periods of July first to December  thirty-first  and  January
      first  to  June  thirtieth,  respectively.  It shall be unlawful for any
      person to fail to submit a report in accordance with this  paragraph  or
      to submit a report containing false or misleading information.
        4.  i.  The owner or agent of any residential building containing one,
      two or three residential units may enter  into  an  agreement  with  any
      person for the collection of recyclable material from such building.
        ii.  Any  such  agreement  shall  be written; signed and dated by such
      owner and by or on behalf of the person responsible for  the  collection
      of recyclable material from such building; and shall include the address
      of  such  building and the names and telephone numbers of the parties to
      such agreement and shall be in the possession of such person at the time
      such recyclable material is removed. No such agreement may  provide  for
      the collection of department-marked items.
        b.  Refrigerant-containing  and department-marked items. 1. Except for
      an authorized employee or agent of the department, it shall be  unlawful
      for   any   person   to  remove  and  transport  by  motor  vehicle  any
      refrigerant-containing item or  department-marked  item  that  has  been
      placed  by  any  owner,  tenant or occupant of any residential building,
      building occupied by city agencies or institutions, or vacant lot, or by
      their agent, within the  stoop  area,  adjacent  to  the  curb  line  or
      otherwise  adjacent  to such building or lot for collection, removal, or
      refrigerant removal by the department. The owner of  any  motor  vehicle
      used  in violation of this subdivision shall also be liable for any such
      violation. This paragraph shall not apply to any person who has lawfully
      entered into a written agreement with the owner of a building, or his or
      her agent, pursuant to subdivision a of this section for the  collection
      of refrigerant-containing items that are not department-marked items.
        2.  There  shall  be  a  rebuttable  presumption that the owner and/or
      operator of any motor vehicle  carrying  a  department-marked  item  has
      violated  this  subdivision  by  either  (i)  unlawfully  removing  such
      department-marked item or (ii)  directing  or  permitting  an  agent  or
      employee  or  other individual under such person's control to unlawfully
      remove such department-marked item.
        3. For  any  department-marked  item  removed  in  violation  of  this
      subdivision,  a  written  agreement  between  the owner of a residential
      building or an authorized agent of such owner and  the  person  removing
      such  item  shall  not  be  a  defense  in  any  proceeding  before  the
      environmental control board or other court of  appropriate  jurisdiction
      to the improper removal of such item.
    
        c. Commercial buildings. Except for an authorized employee of a person
      licensed  by  or  registered  with  the  business  integrity  commission
      pursuant to subdivision a or b of section 16-505 of this code, it  shall
      be  unlawful for any person to remove and transport by motor vehicle any
      amount  of recyclable material that has been placed by any owner, tenant
      or occupant of a commercial building, or  by  their  agent,  within  the
      stoop  area,  adjacent  to  the  curb line or otherwise adjacent to such
      building  for  collection  or  removal  by  an  entity  licensed  by  or
      registered   with   the   business   integrity  commission  pursuant  to
      subdivision a or b of section 16-505 of this code. It shall be  presumed
      that  a  person  operating  a motor vehicle without plates issued by the
      business integrity commission is not an authorized employee of a  person
      licensed  by  or  registered  with  the  business  integrity  commission
      pursuant to subdivision a or b of section 16-505 of this code. The owner
      of any motor vehicle used in violation of this subdivision shall also be
      liable for any such violation.

        §  16-462 Rewards. The commissioner shall establish a program to allow
      individuals to submit a sworn statement affirming the observation  of  a
      violation  of section 16-461 of this chapter and, where the commissioner
      deems it appropriate, allow for a reward for any such  sworn  statement.
      Where  a  notice  of  violation  or summons is issued for a violation of
      section 16-461 of this chapter based upon a sworn statement  by  one  or
      more  individuals and where the commissioner determines, in the exercise
      of his or her discretion, that such sworn statement, either alone or  in
      conjunction  with  the  testimony  of  the  person submitting such sworn
      statement at a civil or criminal proceeding or in  a  proceeding  before
      the  environmental  control  board,  contributes  to the imposition of a
      civil or criminal penalty upon any person for  a  violation  of  section
      16-461 of this chapter, the commissioner shall offer as a reward to such
      individual  or individuals an amount that, in the aggregate, is equal to
      fifty percent of any civil  or  criminal  penalty  collected.  No  peace
      officer,  employee  of  the  department  or of the environmental control
      board, employee of any company under contract with  the  department,  or
      employee  of  any  governmental  entity  that,  in  conjunction with the
      department, conducts enforcement activity relating  to  a  violation  of
      section  16-461 of this chapter, shall be entitled to obtain the benefit
      of any such reward when acting in the discharge of his or  her  official
      duties.

        §  16-463  Receipt  of  recyclable material. a. 1. Notwithstanding any
      other provision of law, the commissioners  of  sanitation  and  consumer
      affairs, and the chairperson of the business integrity commission, shall
      be   authorized   to   adopt   rules  providing  for  the  licensing  or
      registration, supervision and inspection of the operation and activities
      relating to the purchase and sale, acceptance and storage of  recyclable
      material,  including  but  not limited to scrap metal facilities located

      redemption  center,  dealer or distributor as defined in section 27-1003
      of the environmental conservation law.
        2. Any rules adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall  provide  that
      any  person  who removes refrigerant or contracts with a third party for
      the removal of refrigerant from refrigerant-containing items must submit
      proof that refrigerant removal was conducted in  accordance  with  rules
      and guidelines established by the United States environmental protection
      agency.

      entered into a written agreement pursuant to subdivision  a  of  section
      16-461 of this chapter. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all
      recyclable  material  received for storage, collection or processing was
      generated within the city of New York. This subdivision shall not  apply
      to  a  redemption  center,  dealer  or distributor as defined in section
      27-1003 of the environmental conservation law, or  to  any  person  who,
      using  a  motor  vehicle,  collects recyclable containers in bulk and is

        c. No person shall receive for storage, collection or  processing  any
      department-marked item from any person other than an authorized employee

      residential building or an authorized agent of such  owner,  and  anyone
      delivering  a  department-marked  item  to  such  person  shall not be a
      defense in any proceeding before  the  environmental  control  board  or

      receiving the refrigerant-containing item either  possesses  refrigerant
      recovery   equipment   certified  by  the  United  States  environmental
      protection agency, or has a valid agreement to remove  such  refrigerant
      with  a  person  certified by the United States environmental protection
      agency to remove refrigerant, or is receiving such item  for  reuse  for
      its original purpose.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 16-464
--------------

Section 16-464 ::    
        
     
        § 16-464 Enforcement.  a.  1. Any person who violates paragraph one of

      dollars  for  the  first  offense,  seven  hundred fifty dollars for the
      second offense that occurs on a different day within any  eighteen-month
      period  and one thousand dollars for each subsequent offense that occurs
      on a different day within any eighteen-month period. For the purpose  of
      imposing  a  criminal  fine or civil penalty pursuant to this paragraph,
      every building or lot from which recyclable material  has  been  removed
      unlawfully  shall  constitute  a separate violation for which a criminal
      fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
        2. No person shall be in violation of paragraph one of  subdivision  a
      of  section  16-461  of this chapter if such person has removed three or
      fewer recyclable items, in the aggregate, per day  or  if  such  removed
      items  are  loose, individual magazines or soft-cover books that are not
      bundled and tied together with other mixed paper. This  paragraph  shall
      not  apply  to  any refrigerant-containing item, or any large bulk metal
      item as defined by the  commissioner  by  rule,  or  if  the  department
      observes  the  presence  of  additional recyclable material in the motor
      vehicle. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that  the  presence  of
      such  additional recyclable material in the motor vehicle indicates that
      such material was collected in violation of paragraph one of subdivision
      a of section 16-461 of this chapter.
        3. Any  person  who  violates  subparagraph  i  of  paragraph  two  of

      16-461 of this chapter shall be liable  for  a  civil  penalty  of  five
      hundred dollars.

      (ii) a civil penalty of  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  for  the  first
      offense,  one  thousand  dollars for the second offense that occurs on a
      different day within an eighteen-month  period  and  one  thousand  five
      hundred  dollars  for each subsequent offense that occurs on a different
      day within such eighteen-month period. For the  purpose  of  imposing  a
      criminal  fine  or  civil  penalty  pursuant  to this subdivision, every
      building  or  lot  from  which  recyclable  material  has  been  removed
      unlawfully  shall  constitute  a separate violation for which a criminal
      fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
        c. Any person who violates subdivision c of  section  16-461  of  this
      chapter  shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine of one thousand dollars
      or imprisonment not to exceed forty-eight hours,  or  both,  or  (ii)  a
      civil  penalty  of  one  thousand  dollars for the first offense and two
      thousand dollars for each subsequent offense that occurs on a  different
      day  within  any  eighteen-month  period.  For the purpose of imposing a
      criminal fine or civil  penalty  pursuant  to  this  subdivision,  every
      building  or  lot  from  which  recyclable  material  has  been  removed
      unlawfully shall constitute a separate violation for  which  a  criminal
      fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
        d.  1. Any owner of a motor vehicle used in violation of subdivision a

      fifty dollars for a second offense within any eighteen-month period  and
      one   thousand   dollars   for   each   subsequent  offense  within  any
      eighteen-month period, regardless of whether the same vehicle  was  used
      in  the  subsequent  offense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, such motor
      vehicle owner shall not be liable if such  owner  establishes  that  the
      motor  vehicle was used for purposes of violating the provisions of this
      chapter without such owner's permission.
        2. Any owner of a motor vehicle used in violation of subdivision c  of
      section  16-461  of  this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty of

      each  subsequent offense within any eighteen-month period, regardless of
      whether  the  same  vehicle  was  used  in   the   subsequent   offense.
      Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  such  motor vehicle owner shall not be
      liable if such owner establishes that the motor  vehicle  was  used  for
      purposes  of  violating  the  provisions  of  this  chapter without such
      owner's permission.
        3. Any motor vehicle that has been used or is being used to  commit  a
      violation of subdivision a, b or c of section 16-461 of this chapter may
      be  impounded  by  the department and shall not be released until either
      all storage fees and the applicable fines and penalties have  been  paid
      or a bond has been posted in an amount satisfactory to the commissioner.
      Rules  of the department related to the impoundment and release of motor
      vehicles in chapter five of title sixteen of the rules of  the  city  of
      New  York  shall  be  applicable to the impoundment and release of motor
      vehicles pursuant to this paragraph. The  commissioner  shall  have  the
      power to promulgate amended rules concerning the impoundment and release
      of  motor  vehicles  and  the  payment  of  storage  fees for such motor
      vehicles,  including  the  amounts  and  rates  thereof.  Where  it   is
      determined  that the motor vehicle was not used to commit a violation of
      subdivision a, b or c of section 16-461 of this chapter, such fees shall
      be promptly returned.
        4. In addition to any other penalties provided  in  this  subdivision,
      the  interest of a vehicle owner in any motor vehicle impounded pursuant
      to paragraph three of this subdivision shall be  subject  to  forfeiture
      upon notice and judicial determination thereof if such vehicle owner has
      been  convicted  of or found liable for a violation of this chapter in a
      criminal or civil proceeding or in a proceeding before the environmental
      control board  three  or  more  times,  all  of  which  violations  were
      committed within any eighteen-month period.
        5.  Except  as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the city agency
      having custody of  a  motor  vehicle  after  judicial  determination  of
      forfeiture  shall  no  sooner  than thirty days after such determination
      upon a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited  motor  vehicle
      at public sale. Any person, other than a vehicle owner whose interest is
      forfeited pursuant to this section, who establishes a right of ownership
      in  such motor vehicle, including a part ownership or security interest,
      shall be entitled to delivery of the motor vehicle if such person:
        (i) redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture  by
      payment to the city of the value thereof;
        (ii)  pays  the  reasonable  expenses of the safekeeping of such motor
      vehicle between the time of seizure and such redemption; and
        (iii) asserts a claim within thirty days after judicial  determination
      of forfeiture.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, establishment of a claim shall
      not  entitle  such  person  to  delivery  of  such  vehicle  if the city
      establishes that the violation for which the motor  vehicle  was  seized
      was expressly or impliedly permitted by such person.
    
        e.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision b of section 16-463 of this
      chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine of one thousand  dollars
      or  imprisonment  not  to  exceed  forty eight hours, or both, or (ii) a
      civil penalty of one thousand dollars for  the  first  offense  and  two
      thousand  dollars  for each subsequent offense within any eighteen-month
      period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal  fine  or  civil  penalty
      pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from a separate motor vehicle
      of recyclable material shall constitute a separate violation for which a
      criminal fine or civil penalty may be imposed.
        f.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision c of section 16-463 of this
      chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine  of  one  thousand  five
      hundred  dollars  or  imprisonment  not  to exceed forty eight hours, or
      both, or (ii) a civil penalty of one thousand five hundred  dollars  for
      the first offense and three thousand dollars for each subsequent offense
      within  an eighteen-month period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal
      fine or civil penalty pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from  a
      separate  motor vehicle of department-marked material shall constitute a
      separate violation for which a criminal fine or  civil  penalty  may  be
      imposed.
        g.  Any  person  who  violates subdivision d of section 16-463 of this
      chapter shall be liable for (i) a criminal fine  of  one  thousand  five
      hundred  dollars  or  imprisonment  not  to exceed forty eight hours, or
      both, or (ii) a civil penalty of one thousand five hundred  dollars  for
      the first offense and three thousand dollars for each subsequent offense
      within any eighteen-month period. For the purpose of imposing a criminal
      fine  or civil penalty pursuant to this subdivision, each receipt from a
      separate motor vehicle of a refrigerant-containing item shall constitute
      a separate violation for which a criminal fine or civil penalty  may  be
      imposed.
        h.  The  provisions of this chapter may be enforced by the department,
      the police department,  the  department  of  consumer  affairs  and  the
      business integrity commission.
        i. Where a notice of violation is issued for a violation of any of the
      provisions  of  this  chapter,  such  process shall be returnable to the
      environmental control board or court of appropriate jurisdiction,  which
      shall  have  the  power  to  impose the civil penalties provided in this
      section.
