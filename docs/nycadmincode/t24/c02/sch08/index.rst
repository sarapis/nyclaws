        §  24-257  Powers  of  the  board. (a) The board, in addition to other
      duties assigned to it by law, shall have the power to  conduct  hearings
      pursuant  to  this subchapter and, by the issuance of a subpoena, compel
      the attendance of witnesses and the production of any books,  papers  or
      other things relating to the matter under investigation.
        (b)  The  board  may,  upon  notice pursuant to section 24-259 of this
      code, and after a hearing pursuant to section 24-263 of this code, or in
      default thereof pursuant to section 24-264 of this code: (1)  Order  the
      commissioner  to  revoke  or  suspend  a certificate or tunneling permit
      issued pursuant to this code for  any  device  or  activity  where  such
      device or activity causes, or is maintained or operated so as to cause a
      violation  of  any  provision  of  this  code  or  order  or  regulation
      promulgated by the commissioner or the board;
        (2) Order the owner of any device which causes  or  is  maintained  or
      operated so as to cause a violation of any provision of this code or any
      order  or  regulation  promulgated  by the commissioner or the board, to
      install any apparatus which can reasonably be expected  to  correct  the
      violation, or to repair, properly maintain, replace or alter such device
      in a manner which can reasonably be expected to correct the violation;
        (3) Seal any device which causes or is maintained or operated so as to
      cause  a  violation of any provision of this code or order or regulation
      promulgated by the commissioner or the  board,  except  as  provided  in
      subdivision (c) of this section;
        (4)  Order  any  person  to  cease  and desist from any activity which

      board. Each day during which such violation continues shall constitute a
      separate violation. The board may remit, in whole or  in  part,  such  a
      civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the
      board determination under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is
      no  longer  in  violation  of a provision of this code, or of any order,
      rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board;

         * By the same respondent of the same provision of law, order, rule or
      regulation  and,  if the respondent is the owner, agent, lessee or other
      person in control of the premises with respect to  which  the  violation
      occurred,  at  the  same  premises  (all violations committed within two
      years).
      ________________________________________________________________________
        Each day during which such  violation  continues  shall  constitute  a
      separate  violation.  The  board  may remit, in whole or in part, such a
      civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the
      board determination under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is
      no longer in violation of a provision of this code,  or  of  any  order,
      rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board;
        (6)  Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars
      on any owner of a device for each day such equipment is sealed  pursuant
      to this section;
        (7) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than
      four  thousand  dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or causes or
      permits the breaking of, a seal placed on  a  device  pursuant  to  this
      section.
        (8)  Impose  an  additional civil penalty in the amount of twenty-five
      percent of that  which  would  otherwise  be  imposed  for  each  twelve
      decibels  by which the sound or noise level measured exceeds the maximum
      sound level as contained in subchapters five and six of this chapter.
        (9) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of ten percent of
      the penalty originally imposed, for late payment  of  penalty  for  each
      month,  or  part  thereof, that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no
      event shall the total additional civil penalty exceed  the  maximum  set
      forth  in  the  table  of  civil  penalties,  or as modified pursuant to
      paragraph  eight  of  this  subdivision  or  paragraph   ten   of   this
      subdivision, or both.
        (10)  Order  any  person  to be classified as a persistent violator if
      such person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on one
      or more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be
    
      in violation of this  code,  where  such  repeated  violations  evidence
      substanial  disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent
      violator, the board shall in each instance  double  the  amount  of  the
      penalty  which  it  would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of
      this subdivision. Such double penalties shall be imposed for  violations
      which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding
      at  which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for all
      violations  committed  within  two  years  immediately  following   such
      classification,   after   which  such  classification  shall  terminate.
      However, if at the end of such two year period such person is  still  in
      violation  of  this  code  because  of  a  failure to take or complete a
      corrective action as required by the board,  such  classification  shall
      continue  until  such  time  as such person is no longer in violation of
      this code because of such failure, at  which  time  such  classification
      shall  cease.  Thereafter, the board may again classify such person as a
      persistent violator, on the same basis it used originally.
        (c) The board may, upon notice pursuant  to  section  24-259  of  this
      code:
        (1)  order  any  person  to cease and desist from the operation of any
      listed device without a certificate as required  by  section  24-245  of
      this code and the board may also seal such device;
        (2)  order  any  person  to  cease and desist from tunneling without a
      tunneling permit as required by section 24-245  of  this  code  and  the
      board may also seal any device used in such tunneling;
        (3)  order  any  person  not  in  possession  of  an  after hours work
      authorization issued pursuant to section 24-223 of this  code  to  cease
      and   desist   from   construction  activities  other  than  during  the
      permissible hours specified in section 24-222 of this code and the board
      may also seal any device used in such construction activities;
        (4) order any person to cease and  desist  from  the  operation  of  a
      device  without registration required by section 24-208 of this code and
      the board may also seal such device.
        (d) The board may order the commissioner to install any  apparatus  or
      to repair or alter any device or apparatus which causes or is maintained
      or  operated  so  as to cause a violation of an order issued pursuant to
      paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section, where  such  repairing
      or  alteration  can  reasonably be expected to correct such a violation.
      Any  work  required  under  such  an  order  may  be  executed  by   the
      commissioner   through  the  officers,  agents  or  contractors  of  the
      department. The department shall be reimbursed promptly  for  all  costs
      and  expenses of such work by the owner of the device to which the order
      relates and in respect  to  which  such  expenses  were  incurred.  Such
      expenses  may  be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the
      commissioner.
        (e) If an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions  (b)  and
      (c)  of this section provides for a period of time during which a person
      subject to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board  may
      require the respondent to post a performance bond or other security with
      the  department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the correction
      of such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a  failure
      to  meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the bond
      or  other  security  shall  be  forfeited  and  shall  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner.
        (f)  (1)  The  board  may order any person to cease and desist from an
      activity which it reasonably believes causes  unreasonable  noise  which
      creates  imminent peril to the public health and well being, or to cease
      and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes  constitutes  a
      wilful  or continued violation of any provision of this code or order or
    
      regulation, promulgated by the commissioner or board. Such  order  shall
      be  effective  upon service thereof. Any party affected by such an order
      may request a hearing on written notice, and he or she shall be afforded
      a  hearing,  within  twenty-four  hours  after  service of such request,
      pursuant to section 24-263 of this code. If such an accelerated  hearing
      is  not  requested,  then a hearing shall be afforded within ten days of
      the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its final decision  and
      order  thereon  within  three days from the conclusion of a hearing held
      pursuant to this subdivision.

      shall be given by issuance of a notice of violation.
        (b) Whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe  that  a
      violation  of  any  provision  of  this  code or any order or regulation
      promulgated by the commissioner or the board may exist, he  or  she  may
      cause to have a notice of violation issued and served on:
        (1) The person in violation; or
        (2)  An  owner  with an equity interest in the device in violation, if
      any; or
        (3) If an owner with an equity interest in  the  device  in  violation

      board within five days of receipt of the notice of violation.
        (b) If the allegation in the notice of violation is one  for  which  a
      hearing  is  not  required  by  section  24-257  of  this  code,  and is
      contested, then the respondent must either:
        (1) Include a copy of any tunneling permit  or  certificate  that  the
      respondent asserts was issued by the department; or

      contested, the written response shall contain a concise statement of the
      facts constituting each ground of defense.
        (d) If allegations in the notice of violation are admitted the written
      response of the respondent shall consist of:
        (1) A statement that he or she admits all of the material  allegations
      to be true; and
        (2) A statement of any attempts subsequent to service of the notice of
      violation to comply with this code or with the order or regulation.
        (e)  Failure  of the respondent to serve a written response within the
