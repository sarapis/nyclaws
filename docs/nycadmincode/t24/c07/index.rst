      shall develop  a  list  of  hazardous  substances,  complying  with  the
      requirements  of  section  24-702(j)  of this chapter, within six months
      from enactment  of  this  section  provided  that  if  the  commissioner
      determines  than any substance on the required base list, as established
      by section 24-702(j) of this chapter, should not be placed on the  final
      promulgated list, then the commissioner shall submit a written statement
      to  the  council indicating the reason why an amendment is necessary, at
      least sixty days before the date the list is to take effect. The council
      may within thirty days following receipt of the commissioner's statement
      requesting an amendment either: (i) approve or disapprove such amendment
      or (ii) determine that an additional ten days is needed  to  study  such
      amendment by the adoption of an appropriate resolution. Upon approval by
      the  council,  such  amendment  shall  take  effect  immediately. If the
      council disapproves  such  amendment,  the  commissioner  shall  not  be
      precluded  from  resubmitting  such  amendment to the council at a later
      date. If the council does  not  approve  or  disapprove  such  amendment
      within  such  thirty day period, such amendment shall take effect on the
      thirty-first day after submission to the council unless the council  had
      determined  by resolution that an additional ten days is needed to study
      such amendment, in which case, the amendment shall take  effect  on  the
      forty-first  day after such submission to the council unless the council
      has approved or disapproved such amendment  prior  to  such  forty-first
      day.  Except  for  the substances contained on the special health hazard
      list developed pursuant to the requirements of section  24-704  of  this
      chapter,  any  substance contained on the hazardous substance list shall
      be reported to the commissioner, if such hazardous  substance  has  been
      present  at  a  facility in an amount which exceeds five hundred pounds.
      For the  reporting  period  ending  on  March  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine,  any  mixture  present  in  a  facility  in an amount which
      exceeds five hundred pounds, shall be  reported  if  it  contains  in  a
      concentration  of  one percent or more any hazardous substance listed on
      the New Jersey Special Health Hazards List, a  subcategory  of  the  New
      Jersey Right-to-Know Hazardous Substance List (New Jersey Administrative
      Code, stat. 34: 5A-1 et seq.) as in effect in December, nineteen hundred
      eighty-seven.  For  the  reporting  period  ending March first, nineteen
      hundred ninety, any mixture present in a facility shall be  reported  in
      an  amount  which  exceeds  five  hundred  pounds  if  it  contains in a
      concentration of one tenth of one percent or more of any such  hazardous
      substance.  For  the  reporting  period  ending on March first, nineteen
      hundred ninety-one, the commissioner shall  by  regulation  establish  a
      threshold  reporting quantity for each hazardous substance and hazardous
      substances in mixture that are included on the New Jersey Special Health
      Hazards List shall be reported in the same concentration as required  in
      the previous year. If the commissioner fails to set a specific threshold
      reporting  quantity  by  March  first, nineteen hundred ninety-one, then
      each of the hazardous substances without a specific threshold  reporting
      quantity shall be reported to the commissioner if ten or more pounds are
      present at a facility.

      year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-five, a responsible party of a
      facility where an extremely hazardous substance  or  a  regulated  toxic
      substance  is  present in an amount that equals or exceeds the threshold

      responsible party has filed a  complete  plan,  the  commissioner  shall
      approve  or  make  modifications  to  such  plan  and  shall  notify the
      responsible party filing such plan in writing of his or her approval  or
      modifications.  The  commissioner  shall,  within a reasonable period of
      time prior to approving or making modifications  to  such  plan,  submit

      risk  management  plan,  the  responsible  party  shall incorporate such
      modifications into its risk management plan, provided, however, that the
      responsible party may, within forty-five  days  after  receipt  of  such
      modifications,  submit  alternative modifications to the commissioner or
      explain why the commissioner's  modifications  are  not  necessary.  The

      modifications or explanation and  shall:  (i)  require  the  responsible
      party  to  incorporate, by a date certain not to exceed forty-five days,
      either the commissioner's modifications, the  alternative  modifications
      or  a  combination  of such modifications into its risk management plan,
      (ii) approve the unmodified plan or (iii) disapprove the plan.
        (4) The commissioner shall  provide  a  copy  of  each  approved  risk
      management  plan  to  the  emergency  response  agencies  and  to  other
      governmental entities that may request an approved plan.

      commissioner,  in  consultation  with  the  emergency response agencies,
      shall by rule establish the contents of a risk  management  plan,  which
      shall  be designed to prevent the accidental release and to minimize the
      consequences of any such release of any extremely hazardous or regulated
      toxic substance. The plan shall include but need not be limited to:  (1)
      a  site  plan;  (2)  a  safety  review  of  design  for new and existing
      equipment and processes; (3) an emergency response program, including an

      response  exercises; (4) standard operating procedures; (5) a preventive
      maintenance program for equipment; (6) a training program for  equipment
      operators,  including duration and type of training, and retraining; (7)
    
      accident investigation procedures; and (8) a  risk  assessment  program,
      including  a hazard analysis and a consideration of the use of alternate
      equipment and alternate substances.
        (d)  Preparation  of  risk  management  plan. The risk management plan

      shall   contain   proof   satisfactory   to   the  commissioner  of  the
      qualifications of the person who prepared such plan.
        (e) The risk management plan shall be  made  available  to  department
      personnel at the time of an inspection of a facility for which a plan is
      required pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section.
        (f)  On  or  before  November first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, the
      commissioner, in consultation with emergency  response  agencies,  shall
      make  reasonable  efforts  to provide information to responsible parties
      regarding the requirements of this section  and  the  rules  promulgated
