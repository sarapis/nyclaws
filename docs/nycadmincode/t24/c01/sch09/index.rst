        (ii) Impose a separate penalty for each day on which a violation under
      this code shall have occurred.
        (iii)  Remit,  in  whole  or  in  part,  such civil penalty if, at the
      conclusion of the hearing, or at the time  of  the  board  determination
      under section 24-187 of this code, or at the date on which a stipulation
      is  executed  by the parties in settlement of the proceeding pursuant to
      section 24-183 of this code, the respondent is no longer in violation of
      a provision of this code or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated
      thereunder  and  is  not  in  default  under  section  24-185  of   this
      subchapter.
        (iv) Impose an additional civil penalty, in the amount of ten per cent
      (10%) of the penalty originally imposed, for late payment of penalty for
      each month or part thereof that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no
      event  shall  the  total additional civil penalty exceed the maximum set
      forth in the table of civil penalties or schedules E, F and G  of  civil
      penalties for equipment requiring operating certificates, or as modified
      pursuant to paragraph six of subdivision (b) of this section.
        (v) Remit in whole or in part, such civil penalty at the conclusion of
      the  hearing,  or  at  a  date on which a stipulation is executed by the
      parties in proceedings pursuant to section 24-183 of  this  chapter,  if
      the  respondent  was  in  violation  of  this code through the action or
      inaction of an agency of the city of New York and not through the action
      or inaction of the respondent.
        (6) Order any person to be classified as a persistent violator if such
      person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on  one  or
      more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in
      violation   of  this  code,  where  such  repeated  violations  evidence
    
      substantial disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent
      violator, the board shall in each instance  double  the  amount  of  the
      penalty  which  it  would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of
      this  subdivision. Such double penalties shall be imposed for violations
      which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding
      at which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for  all
      violations  committed  within  the  two years immediately following such
      classification,  after  which  such  classification   shall   terminate.
      However,  if  at the end of such two year period such person is still in
      violation of this code because of  a  failure  to  take  or  complete  a
      corrective  action  as  required by the board, such classification shall
      continue until such time as such person is no  longer  in  violation  of
      this  code  because  of  such failure, at which time such classification
      shall cease. Thereafter, the board may again classify such person  as  a
      persistent violator, on the same basis it used originally.
        (7)  Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars
      on any owner of equipment for each day such equipment is sealed pursuant
      to this section;
        (8) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than
      four thousand dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or  causes  or
      permits  the  breaking  of,  a seal placed on equipment pursuant to this
      section.
        (9) Order any person or the commissioner to install any  apparatus  or
      to clean, repair or alter any equipment or apparatus which causes, or is
      maintained or operated so as to cause, a violation of this code.
        (c)  The  board  may,  upon  notice pursuant to section 24-180 of this
      code, order any person to:
        (1) Cease and desist from the installation or alteration of  equipment
      or  apparatus,  without  a  permit as required by section 24-120 of this
      code;
        (2) Cease and desist from the operation of any equipment or  apparatus
      without  a certificate and the board may also seal any such equipment or
      apparatus;
        (3) Cease and desist from the spraying of insulating material  on,  or
      the  demolition  of, any building or structure which does not conform to
      the requirements of section 24-109 or 24-146 of this code. The board may
      also seal any equipment used therefor.
        (d) The board may order the commissioner to install any  apparatus  or
      to clean, repair, or alter any equipment or apparatus which causes or is
      maintained  or  operated  so  as to cause a violation of an order issued
      pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section, where such
      installation, cleaning,  repairing,  or  alteration  can  reasonably  be
      expected  to  correct  such a violation. Any work required under such an
      order may be executed by the commissioner through the  officers,  agents
      or  contractors  of  the  department. The department shall be reimbursed
      promptly for all costs and expenses of such work by  the  owner  of  the
      equipment  or  apparatus  to  which  the order relates and in respect to
      which such expenses were incurred. Such expenses may be recovered  in  a
      civil action brought in the name of the commissioner.
        (e)  If  an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions (b) and
      (c) of this section provides for a period of time during which a  person
      subject  to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board may
      require the respondent to post a performance bond or other security with
      the department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the  correction
      of  such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a failure
      to meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the  bond
      or  other  security  shall  be  forfeited  and  shall  be  paid  to  the
      commissioner.
    
        (f) The board may order  any  person  to  cease  and  desist  from  an
      activity  which  it  reasonably  believes  causes  an emission of an air
      contaminant which creates an imminent peril to the public  health.  Such
      order  shall  be  effective  upon service thereof. Any party affected by
      such  an  order  may  request a hearing on written notice, and he or she
      shall be afforded a hearing, within twenty-four hours after  service  of
      such  request,  pursuant  to  section  24-184  of  this code. If such an
      accelerated hearing is not requested, then a hearing shall  be  afforded
      within  ten days of the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its
      final decision and order thereon within three days from  the  conclusion
      of a hearing held pursuant to this subsection.

      shall be given by issuance of a notice of violation.
        (b)  Whenever  the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a
      violation of any provision of this  code  or  any  order  or  regulation
      promulgated  thereunder  may exist, he or she may cause to have a notice
      of violation issued and served on:
        (1) The person in violation; or
        (2) An owner with an equity interest in the equipment in violation; or
        (3) If an owner with an equity interest in the equipment in  violation
      cannot be located with due diligence, any other owner of said equipment.
        (c) A notice of violation shall:

      code; and
        (5)  Require  such  person  or  owner  of  equipment  to  answer   the
      allegations  in  the notice of violation at a designated time and place,
      unless a hearing is not required by section 24-178 of this code.

      hearing  is  not  required  by  section  24-178  of  this  code,  and is
      contested, then the respondent must either:
        (1) Include a copy of any permit or certificate  that  the  respondent
      asserts was issued by the department; or
        (2) Deny that such permit or certificate is required by law.
        (c) If any of the allegations in the notice of violation are those for
      which  a  hearing  is  required  by section 24-178 of this code, and are
      contested, the written response shall contain a concise statement of the
      facts constituting each ground of defense.
        (d) If allegations in  the  notice  of  violation  are  admitted,  the
      written response of the respondent shall consist of:

      to be true; and
        (2) A statement of any attempts subsequent to service of the notice of
      violation to comply with this code or with the order or regulation.
        (e) Failure of the respondent to serve a written response  within  the
      time provided shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of his or her right
      to appear and contest the allegations in the notice.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 24-182
--------------

Section 24-182 ::    
        
     
        §  24-182 Citizen's complaint. (a) Any person, other than personnel of
      the department and employees of the city of New York authorized  by  law
      to  serve  summonses  for  violations  of  the  code, may serve upon the
      department a complaint, in a form prescribed by the department, alleging
      that a person has violated any  provision  of  this  code  or  order  or
      regulation  promulgated  by  the  commissioner or the board, except with
      respect to sections 24-143, 24-150 and 24-163 of this  code,  but  still
      applicable  to  buses  as  defined  in  section  one hundred four of the
      vehicle and traffic law and trucks as defined  in  section  one  hundred
      fifty  eight  of  the vehicle and traffic law, together with evidence of

      the observation, may serve such complaint.
        (b) A person who has served a complaint pursuant to subdivision (a) of
      this  section may serve upon the person allegedly in violation, and upon
      the board, a notice of violation in  a  form  prescribed  by  the  board
      within forty-five days from service of such complaint if;
        (1) The department has failed to serve a notice of violation, pursuant
      to section 24-180 of this code, for the violation alleged in a complaint
      pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section; or
        (2)   The  department  fails  to  serve  a  written  notice  upon  the
      complainant of its determination that his or her complaint is  frivolous
      or duplicitous.
        (c)  A  person  commencing a proceeding pursuant to this section shall
      prosecute such proceeding at his or her own expense. The department  may
      intervene in such a proceeding at any time.
        (d)  In  any  proceeding  brought  by the department after receiving a
      complaint, pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, pertaining to  a
      violation  of  this  code  or any regulation or order promulgated by the
      commissioner or the board, wherein the source  of  the  violation  is  a
      manufacturing or industrial facility or a facility for the generation of
      steam for off-premises sale or electricity or equipment used by any such
      facility,  the  board  shall  award the complainant, out of the proceeds
      collected, an amount which shall not exceed twenty-five percent of  such
      proceeds,  for  disclosure  of  information  or  evidence,  not  in  the
      possession of the department prior to the receipt of  the  complaint  by
      the department, which leads to the imposition of the civil penalty.
        (e) In any proceeding brought by a complainant pursuant to subdivision
      (a)  of  this  section,  the  board  shall  award,  out  of the proceeds
      collected, fifty percent of any civil penalty  as  fair  and  reasonable
      compensation to such person.

      in default when the respondent has:
        (1) Failed to serve a written response pursuant to section  24-181  of
      this code; or
        (2)  Failed  to appear at the designated time and place as required by

        (b)  Within  sixty  days  of  a decision and order of the board issued
      pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision  (c)  of  section  24-187,  the
      respondent  may  request  the board to grant a stay of such order of the
      board and schedule a hearing. If the respondent has shown good cause and
      a meritorious defense, the board may  grant  such  request  and  hold  a
      hearing  pursuant  to  section  24-184 of this code. At the hearing, the
      board may adopt, amend, or rescind its decision and order.

      conclusions, as well as reasons for his  or  her  determination  on  all
      material issues, and making recommendations as to action which should be
      taken in the matter.

      the parties. Any party may file exceptions with the board within  twenty
      days  after  service  of such decision. If no exceptions have been filed
