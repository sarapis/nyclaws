        (i) a sufficient quantity of bioheating fuel  containing  two  percent
      biodiesel is not available in the city for that boiler type;
        (ii) the price of available bioheating fuel for that boiler type is at

      warranty for that boiler type; or
        (iv) there is no applicable American Society of Testing and  Materials
      standard  or  other standard as determined by the commissioner to govern
      the specification of the bioheating fuel for purposes of receiving  bids
      and enforcing contracts.

      commissioner  finds  based  on documentation submitted by the applicant,
      including but not limited  to  a  report  certified  by  a  professional
      engineer,  that  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph 1 of
      subdivision b of this section would result in damage to  equipment  used
      to  generate  steam within such district steam system. Any waiver issued
      pursuant to this paragraph shall expire after one year,  unless  renewed
      in writing by the commissioner.
        (d)(1)  No later than September 1, 2013, and no later than September 1
      of every year thereafter, the commissioner shall submit a report to  the
      mayor and the speaker of the council, which shall include:

        (i) the amount in gallons of each fuel  oil  grade  supplied  by  such
      person to buildings by zip code; and
        (ii)  the  average  percentage of biodiesel blended into each fuel oil
      grade supplied by such person within the city and the types of feedstock
      used in the creation of such biodiesel.
        (2) The commissioner  shall  prescribe  the  form  in  which  required
      information  shall  be  reported  annually  to the department. Such form

      oil purchased for use in  any  building  owned  by  the  city  shall  be
      bioheating  fuel containing not less than five percent biodiesel (B5) by
      volume except that the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to
      the use of emergency generators.
        (2)  The  commissioner  of  citywide  administrative  services   shall
      institute  a  pilot  program  to  use  greater  amounts  of biodiesel in
      city-owned buildings. Such pilot program shall  require  that  beginning
      October first, two thousand fourteen, the heating oil burned in not less
      than  five  percent  of  city-owned buildings shall contain at least ten
      percent biodiesel (B10) by volume. Such  pilot  program  shall  continue
      until  October  first, two thousand fifteen and within six months of the
      conclusion  of  such  pilot  program,  the  commissioner   of   citywide
      administrative  services  shall  issue  a  report  to  the mayor and the
      speaker of the council detailing the findings  of  such  pilot  program,
      including  the  utility of and any impediments to the use of ten percent
      biodiesel  (B10)   by   volume   in   city-owned   buildings   and   any
      recommendations  for the use of ten percent biodiesel (B10) by volume in

      conjunction  with  the  office  of long-term planning and sustainability
      shall undertake a one year study on the feasibility of the use  of  five
      percent  biodiesel  (B5) by volume in all buildings throughout the city.
      Such study shall include recommendations on whether and  when  the  city
      should  require  the  use  of  five  percent biodiesel (B5) by volume in
      heating oil in all buildings and shall be issued to the  mayor  and  the
      speaker of the council by April first, two thousand fifteen.

      commissioner  that  the  fuel  burning  equipment  is operated in such a
      manner, or is equipped with such control apparatus, as  to  continuously
      prevent  the  emission  of any sulfur compound or compounds in an amount
      greater than that which would have  been  emitted  from  the  same  fuel
      burning  equipment,  if  operated,  in the absence of control apparatus,
      using fuel which  complies  with  the  sulfur  content  restrictions  of
      section 24-169 of this code.

      temporary  sulfur  exemption  certificate shall be made for each unit of
      fuel burning equipment for which exemption is sought.
        (f) In addition to the conditions and limitations for the issuance  of
      a sulfur exemption certificate or temporary sulfur exemption certificate
      specified  in  this  section,  the commissioner may provide such further
      conditions or limitations as he or she may deem appropriate.
