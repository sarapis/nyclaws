                                         computing the lower-based

                                         and the higher based
                                         component shall be computed
                                         on a base sum $500 higher
                                         than the base sum required to
                                         be used in computing the

      and each succeeding
      anniversary year                   $12,000
     
        (ii-a)  for  each  calendar  year  which occurs both after the year of
      retirement and after December thirty-first, two thousand seven (but  not
      including the calendar year of the beneficiary's death), notwithstanding
      any  provision  of  subparagraph  (ii) of this paragraph which otherwise
      would be applicable, a single annual payment of twelve thousand dollars,
      which payment (A) shall be in lieu of any other amount  which  otherwise

      calendar year and (B) shall be made on or about  December  fifteenth  of
      such year;
        (iii) (A) for the calendar year of the beneficiary's death, where such
      death  occurs  both  after  the  year of retirement and prior to January
      first, two thousand eight, an amount calculated in accordance  with  the
      formula  which  would apply to the year of death under subparagraph (ii)
      of this paragraph nine if such death had not occurred, but  prorated  on
      the  basis  of  the number of full calendar months the beneficiary lived
      during the year of death prior to the month of his or her death;
        (B) for the calendar year of the beneficiary's death, where such death
      occurs both after the year of retirement and in the  calendar  year  two
      thousand  eight  or  thereafter,  an  amount  calculated  by multiplying
      one-twelfth of twelve thousand dollars  by  the  number  of  months  the
      beneficiary  lived during the year of death prior to the month of his or
      her death; and
        (iv) if the retirement and death of a beneficiary occur  in  the  same
      calendar  year,  aggregate  payments  under  subparagraphs (i) and (iii)
      above shall be made only in respect to  calendar  months  following  the

      (iv) of this paragraph one, on or after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight,  where  a  pension fund beneficiary is entitled to receive
      variable supplements payments pursuant to subdivision a of this section,
      and  that  beneficiary  is  also  entitled  to  receive  a  supplemental
    
      retirement  allowance or cost-of-living adjustment pursuant to any other
      provision of law enacted  on  or  after  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight  (hereinafter referred to as "other supplemental retirement
      allowance"),  the  amount  of  such  variable  supplement  payable for a
      calendar year or a part of such calendar year to such beneficiary  shall
      be reduced by the amount of such other supplemental retirement allowance
      that  is  payable  to  such  beneficiary  to  the extent that such other
      supplemental retirement allowance is attributable to the  same  calendar
      year or part of such calendar year.
        (ii)  For any pension fund beneficiary referred to in paragraph two or
      paragraph seven or paragraph eight of subdivision  a  of  this  section,
      whose  variable  supplements  payments  are  being  reduced  pursuant to
      subparagraph (i) of this paragraph one because such  other  supplemental
      retirement  allowance is also payable to that beneficiary, the reduction
      provided for in such subparagraph (i) shall cease as to such beneficiary
      on the later of (A) the first day of the month next following the  month
      in  which  such beneficiary attains age sixty-two; or (B) January first,
      two thousand seven.

      of  subdivision  a  of this section, whose variable supplements payments
      are being reduced pursuant to subparagraph (i)  of  this  paragraph  one
      because  such other supplemental retirement allowance is also payable to
      that beneficiary, the reduction provided for in  such  subparagraph  (i)
      shall  cease as to such beneficiary on the later of (A) the first day of
      the month following the month in  which  such  beneficiary  attains  age
      sixty-two;  or  (B)  the  earlier of (1) the first day of the month next
      following  the  month  in  which  the  nineteenth  anniversary  of   the
      retirement of such beneficiary occurs or (2) January first, two thousand
      eight.
        (iv)  In any case where the reduction of variable supplements payments
      to a pension fund beneficiary has ceased pursuant to  subparagraph  (ii)
      or  subparagraph  (iii) of this paragraph one, that beneficiary, for the
      purpose of determining his or her eligibility for and the amount of  any
      other supplemental retirement allowance, shall be deemed to have retired
      on  the  date  of  the  cessation  of  such  reduction  specified in the
      applicable provisions of such subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii).
        (v) The payment  of  all  variable  supplements  payable  pursuant  to
      subdivision  a  of this section are hereby made obligations of the city,
      and the city hereby guarantees that such supplements shall  be  paid  to
      all eligible pension fund beneficiaries.
        (2)  The  legislature  hereby  declares  that the variable supplements
      authorized by this subchapter and the granting and receipt thereof:
        (i) shall  not  create  or  constitute  membership  in  a  pension  or
      retirement system and shall not create or constitute a contract with any
      pension  fund beneficiary or with any member of pension fund, subchapter
      one or pension fund, subchapter two; and (ii)  shall  not  constitute  a
      pension   or   retirement  allowance  or  benefit  under  pension  fund,
      subchapter one or pension fund, subchapter two or otherwise.
        (3) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision f of this section  and
      in  sections  13-232  and 13-232.1 of this chapter, nothing contained in

      funds or monies thereof,  or  authorize  such  funds  or  monies  to  be
      appropriated  or  used  for any payment under this subchapter or for any
      purpose thereof.

      invested as authorized by section 13-273 of this subchapter.
        e.  In addition to the payments set forth in paragraphs eight and nine
      of subdivision a of this section, there shall be paid  to  each  pension
      fund beneficiary, on or about the December fifteenth next succeeding his
      or  her  date of retirement, an amount equal to the variable supplements
      payments, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  of
      paragraph  one  of  subdivision  b of this section, that he or she would
      have received, had he or she retired on the date of his or her  earliest
      eligibility  for service retirement, in the period measured from (1) the
      later of (i) such earliest eligibility date and (ii)  January  1,  2002,
      and (2) his or her date of retirement.
        f.  In  the event that the assets of the variable supplements fund are
      not sufficient to pay benefits under this section for any calendar year,
      an amount sufficient to pay such benefits shall be appropriated from the
      contingent reserve fund of pension fund, subchapter two and  transferred
      to the police officers' variable supplements fund.
