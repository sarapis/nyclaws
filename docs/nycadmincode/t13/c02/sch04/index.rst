      the month next following the month in which such beneficiary attains age

        (iv) In any case where the reduction of variable supplements  payments
      to  a  pension fund beneficiary has ceased pursuant to subparagraph (ii)
      or subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph one, that beneficiary,  for  the
      purpose  of determining his or her eligibility for and the amount of any
      other supplemental retirement allowance, shall be deemed to have retired
      on the date  of  the  cessation  of  such  reduction  specified  in  the
      applicable provisions of such subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii).
        (v)  The  payments  of  all  variable  supplements payable pursuant to

      and  the  city  hereby guarantees that such supplements shall be paid to
      all eligible pension fund beneficiaries.
        (2) The legislature hereby  declares  that  the  variable  supplements
      authorized by this subchapter and the granting and receipt thereof:
        (i)  shall  not  create  or  constitute  membership  in  a  pension or

      pension fund beneficiary or with any member of pension fund,  subchapter
      one or pension fund, subchapter two; and

        e.  In addition to the payments set forth in paragraphs three and four
      of subdivision a of this section, there shall be paid  to  each  pension

      payments, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs  (i)  and  (ii)  of
      paragraph  one  of  subdivision  b of this section, that he or she would
      have received, had he or she retired on the date of his or her  earliest
