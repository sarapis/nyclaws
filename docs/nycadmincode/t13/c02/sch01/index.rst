        8. a. A sum of money equal to but not greater than:

      for additional duties assigned to him or her, the comptroller shall make
      such  semi-monthly  deductions on the basis of such extra pay, salary or

      trustees his or her election to have his or her benefits and obligations
      computed on the basis of the pay, salary or compensation received by him
      or her prior to the time when  he  or  she  first  received  such  extra
      compensation.  Members  who  heretofore  or are now receiving such extra

      extra pay, salary or compensation for an aggregate of five years or more
      or for the period of time fixed by section  14-114  of  this  code,  the
      comptroller  shall  continue to make such semi-monthly deductions on the
      basis of such extra pay, salary or  compensation,  notwithstanding  that
      such  member  does  not continue to receive it, unless such member shall
      signify to the board of trustees in writing his or her election to  have
      his  or  her  benefits and obligations computed on the basis of the pay,
      salary or compensation actually  received  by  him  or  her.  Additional
      deductions  made  pursuant to this subdivision shall entitle such member
      to a pension on the basis of such extra pay, salary or compensation. The
      provisions of this subdivision shall not diminish or impair the benefits
      provided in subdivision c of section 14-114 of this code.
        9. If the amount derived from the above-mentioned sources included  in
      this  section  shall  be  insufficient  to pay the pensions, allowances,
      benefits and returns of salary deductions which have been or  which  may
      hereafter  be  granted,  it shall be the duty of the police commissioner
      each year at the time of submitting the  departmental  estimate  to  the
      director  of  the budget, to submit a full and detailed statement of the
      assets of such fund and the amount required to  pay  all  such  sums  in
      full. There shall annually be included in the budget a sum sufficient to
      provide  for  such  deficiency.  The  comptroller shall pay the money so
      provided to the board of trustees.
        10. Such board of trustees is authorized, empowered  and  entitled  to
      take  and  hold  any and all gifts or bequests which may be made to such
      fund or to any police pension fund existing prior to the  first  day  of
      January,  eighteen  hundred  ninety-eight  in  any  of the territory now
      constituting the city of New York.
        11. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, on and
      after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, the composition of  this
      pension  fund shall be as modified by the provisions of section 13-213.1
      of this subchapter.

Section 13-206 ::    
        
     
        §  13-206  Payment of pensions; disability; retirement for service. a.
      The board of trustees shall retire any member who, upon an  examination,
      as  provided  in  subdivision  d  of  this  section,  may be found to be
      disqualified, physically or mentally, for the performance of his or  her
      duties.  Such  member so retired shall receive from such pension fund an
      annual pension as provided in this section. In  every  case  such  board
      shall  determine  the circumstances thereof, and such pension so allowed
      is to be in lieu of any salary received by such member at  the  time  of
      his  or her being so retired. The department shall not be liable for the
      payment of any claim or demand for services thereafter rendered, and the
      amount  of  such  pension  shall  be  determined  upon   the   following
      conditions:
        1.  In  case  of  total  permanent disability at any time caused in or
      induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her  position,
      the  amount  of  annual  pension  to  be  allowed shall be not less than
      three-fourths of the annual salary of such member at the date of his  or
      her retirement.
        1-a.  In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph one
      of  this  subdivision  a,  a  pension  equal  to   but   not   exceeding
      three-fourths  of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or
      her retirement, such member shall receive, in addition,  the  amount  of
      the  deductions,  without  interest, made from his or her pay, salary or
      compensation pursuant to subdivision nine  of  section  13-203  of  this
      subchapter,  such  amount to be paid either in a lump sum or in the form
      of an annuity which is  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  such  amount  of
      deductions,  as the member may elect. Such annuity, if so elected, shall
      be computed on the basis of the mortality  tables  adopted  pursuant  to
      section  13-221  of this chapter, as in effect on the date of retirement
      of such member, and on the basis of regular interest.
        2. In case of partial permanent disability at any time  caused  in  or
      induced  by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position,
      which disqualifies him or her only from performing active  duty  in  the
      police   force,  the  member  so  disabled  shall  be  relieved  by  the
      commissioner from active service and assigned to the performance of such
      light duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify  him  or
      her  to be qualified to perform, or he or she shall be retired on his or
      her own application at not less than three-fourths of his or her  salary
      at  the  date  of  his  or  her  retirement  from  the  service,  on  an
      examination, as provided by subdivision d of this section, showing  that
      his or her disability is permanent.
        2-a.  In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph two
      of  this  subdivision  a,  a  pension  equal  to   but   not   exceeding
      three-fourths  of his or her salary at the date of his or her retirement
      from the service, such member shall receive, in addition, the amount  of
      the  deductions,  without  interest, made from his or her pay, salary or
      compensation pursuant to subdivision nine  of  section  13-203  of  this
      subchapter,  such  amount to be paid either in a lump sum or in the form
      of an annuity which is  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  such  amount  of
      deductions,  as the member may elect. Such annuity, if so elected, shall
      be computed on the basis of the mortality  tables  adopted  pursuant  to
      section  13-221  of this chapter, as in effect on the date of retirement
      of such member, and on the basis of regular interest.
        3. In case of total permanent disability not caused in or  induced  by
      the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which shall
      occur after the expiration of ten years' service in such department, but
      before he or she has performed service in the force for a period greater
      than  the  minimum  period for service retirement elected by him or her,
      the amount of annual pension to be allowed  shall  be  one-half  of  the
    
      annual  salary  of such member at the date of his or her retirement from
      the service.
        4. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the  actual  performance of the duties of his or her position, which may
      occur after ten  years'  service  in  such  department,  the  member  so
      disabled  may  be  relieved by the commissioner from active service, but
      shall remain a  member  of  the  police  force,  subject  to  the  rules
      governing  such  force, and be assigned to the performance of such light
      duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify him or her  to
      be  qualified  to  perform,  or,  if  such  member  be retired after the
      expiration of ten years' service, but before he  or  she  has  performed
      service  in  the  force for a period greater than the minimum period for
      service retirement elected by him or her, the annual pension to be  paid
      to  such member shall be one-half of the annual salary of such member at
      the date of his or her retirement from the service.
        5. In case of total permanent disability not caused in or  induced  by
      the  actual  performance of the duties of his or her position, which may
      occur before the expiration of ten years' service  in  such  department,
      the  amount  of  annual  pension to be allowed shall be one-third of the
      annual salary of such member at the date of his or her  retirement  from
      the service.
        6. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by
      the  actual  performance of the duties of his or her position, which may
      occur before ten years'  service  in  such  department,  the  member  so
      disabled  shall be relieved by the commissioner from active service, but
      shall remain a  member  of  the  police  force,  subject  to  the  rules
      governing  such  force, and be assigned to the performance of such light
      duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify him or her  to
      be  qualified  to  perform,  or,  if  such  member be retired before the
      expiration of ten years' service, the annual pension to be paid to  such
      member  shall  be  one-third  of the annual salary of such member at the
      date of his or her retirement from the service.
        b. Any member of such department, who has or shall have performed duty
      therein for a  period  of  twenty  years  or  upwards,  upon  a  medical
      examination,  as provided in subdivision d of this section, showing that
      such member is permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be
      unfit for duty, shall be retired from such force and service, and placed
      on the roll of the pension fund, and awarded and  granted,  to  be  paid
      from such fund:
        1.  an  annual  pension  during his or her lifetime, of a sum not less
      than one-half his or  her  full  salary  at  the  date  of  his  or  her
      retirement from the service; and
        2. if such member is awarded and granted, pursuant to paragraph one of
      this  subdivision  b,  an  annual  pension  equal  to  but not exceeding
      one-half of his or her full salary at the date of his or her  retirement
      from  the  service,  and if such member, at the time of such retirement,
      has performed service in the force for a number of  years  greater  than
      the  minimum  period  for  service  retirement elected by him or her, an
      annual pension, in addition to the pension provided for by paragraph one
      of this subdivision b, which shall be equal to: (i) one-fortieth of  his
      or  her full salary or compensation on the date of his or her retirement
      from the service, multiplied by the number of years of  service  in  the
      force performed by him or her after completion of such minimum period of
      service  elected  by him or her, if such member elected a minimum period
      of twenty years; or
        (ii) one-fiftieth of his or her full salary  or  compensation  on  the
      date of his or her retirement from the service, multiplied by the number
      of  years  of  service  in  the  force  performed  by  him  or her after
    
      completion of such minimum period of service elected by him or  her,  if
      such member elected a minimum period of twenty-five years.
        c. Any member who:
        1.  Shall  have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after
      twenty years of service and who has or shall have performed  service  in
      the force for at least twenty years, or
        2.  Shall  have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after
      twenty-five years of service and who has or shall have performed service
      in the force for at  least  twenty-five  years,  upon  his  or  her  own
      application in writing to and filed with the board setting forth at what
      time,  not  less than thirty days subsequent to the execution and filing
      thereof, he or she desires to be retired, shall be  retired  as  of  the
      date  specified  in  said  application  from such force and service, and
      placed on the roll of the pension fund, and awarded and granted,  to  be
      paid  from  such fund, an annual pension during his or her lifetime, not
      less than one-half of his or her full salary at the date of his  or  her
      retirement  from  service,  and  provided  further  that  at the time so
      specified for his or her retirement his or her term or tenure of  office
      or employment shall not have terminated or have been forfeited, provided
      further  that  upon  his  or  her request in writing the member shall be
      granted a leave of absence from the  date  of  filing  said  application
      until the date the retirement becomes effective.
        d.  All  medical  examinations  required  by  or  made pursuant to the
      provisions of this subchapter shall be  conducted  by  a  medical  board
      appointed  by  the  commissioner,  provided,  however,  that any member,
      within thirty days after receipt of the decision of such medical  board,
      in  writing may request that the decision of such board be reviewed by a
      special medical board which shall consist of one doctor of  the  medical
      board and a doctor selected and compensated by such member. The decision
      of such special board shall supersede the decision of the medical board.
      In the event that the two doctors of the special board shall disagree, a
      recognized specialist on the condition, disease or injury for which such
      member  has  been  examined  or for which disability is claimed shall be
      selected by such doctors to be a third member of the special board.  The
      decision  of a majority of the three members of such special board shall
      supersede the decision of the medical board. The specialist selected  by
      the  two  doctors of the special board shall be compensated by the city.
      Such compensation shall be fixed by the comptroller and shall be subject
      to his or her audit.
        e. The board of trustees shall have the power to grant, award or pay a
      pension on account of physical or mental  disability  or  disease,  only
      upon  a  certificate of a medical board or a special medical board after
      examination  as  provided  in  subdivision  d  of  this  section.   Such
      certificate  shall  set  forth  the  cause,  nature  and  extent  of the
      disability, disease or injury of such member.
        f. (1) In any case where a person who retired for service as a  member
      of  the  pension fund is subsequently appointed police commissioner or a
      deputy police commissioner, his or her pension shall cease.  During  his
      or  her  service as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner he
      or she shall again be a member of the pension fund and shall  contribute
      thereto at the rate of contribution applicable to him or her at the time
      of his or her prior retirement.
        (2)  Subject  to  the  provisions of paragraphs three and four of this
      subdivision  f,  upon  his  or  her  subsequent  retirement  as   police
      commissioner  or  deputy  police commissioner, as the case may be, he or
      she shall receive the pension, if any, which he or she was receiving  or
      entitled  to  receive  immediately  prior  to  his or her appointment as
      police commissioner or deputy police commissioner, and  in  addition,  a
    
      further  pension  of  one-sixtieth  of  his or her average annual salary
      earned  during  his  or  her  credited  service  after  restoration   to
      membership  pursuant  to paragraph one of this subdivision f, multiplied
      by  the  number  of  years  of  his  or her credited service during such
      restoration.
        (3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph four of this subdivision f,
      where any such retiree who is appointed police  commissioner  or  deputy
      police  commissioner  shall  have  earned at least three years of member
      credit for service during the  period  of  his  or  her  restoration  to
      membership  pursuant  to  paragraph one of this subdivision f, the total
      service credit to which he or she was entitled at the time of his or her
      earlier retirement may, at his or her election, again be credited to him
      or her and upon his or her subsequent retirement as police  commissioner
      or  deputy  police  commissioner, as the case may be, he or she shall be
      credited in addition with all service during such period of  restoration
      to membership.
        (4)  Such  total service credit to which he or she was entitled at the
      time of his or her earlier retirement shall be credited as  provided  in
      paragraph  three  of this subdivision f only in the event that he or she
      returns  to  the  pension  fund  with  regular  interest  the  actuarial
      equivalent  of  the  amount  of  the  amount  of  the  pension he or she
      received; provided, however, that in the event that such amount  is  not
      so  repaid,  the actuarial equivalent thereof shall be deducted from his
      or her subsequent pension.
        g. The granting of a pension on severance from service  for  fault  or
      delinquency  shall  not  be a matter of right, but such a pension may be
      granted in consideration  of  special  circumstances  by  the  board  of
      trustees  and a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole number of votes
      authorized to be cast by all the members of such board.
        h. The terms  "total  permanent  disability"  and  "partial  permanent
      disability"  as  used  in  this  section may be defined in the rules and
      regulations of the board of trustees.
        i. Except as otherwise  provided,  the  pensions  granted  under  this
      section  shall  be  for  the  life  of  the  pensioner, and shall not be
      revoked, repealed or diminished.
        j. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, and  in  lieu  of
      any  lesser  amount otherwise provided, any member of the department who
      has or shall have performed duty  therein  for  a  period  of  at  least
      thirty-five  years may elect to be retired and placed on the roll of the
      pension fund, and awarded and granted, to be paid  from  such  fund,  an
      annual  pension during his or her lifetime, of a sum equal to his or her
      full salary at the date of his or her retirement from service.

Section 13-207 ::    
        
     
        §  13-207  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13-206 of this
      subchapter, in any case where a pension was  or  is  awarded  under  the
      provisions  of such section, by reason of the retirement of a member for
      disability caused or induced by the actual performance of the duties  of
      his  or  her position, such member shall be entitled to a pension of not
      less than three-fourths the annual salary or compensation payable  to  a
      first grade patrolman as of July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five.
      In  the  case  of any member receiving a pension less than three-fourths
      the annual salary or compensation of a first grade patrolman as of  July
      first,  nineteen  hundred  and  sixty-five  his  or her pension shall be
      increased by such amount which when added to the  lesser  pension  shall
      equal  three-fourths  the annual salary or compensation of a first grade
      patrolman as of July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five.
        b. Such pension shall be payable to the  same  persons  and  shall  be
      subject  to  the  same  terms and conditions, including provisions as to
      termination as to the pension which would  otherwise  be  payable  under
      section 13-206 of this subchapter.
        c.  The  pension  payable  under  this section shall be in lieu of any
      pension which would otherwise be payable to  the  member  under  section
      13-206 of this subchapter.

Section 13-208 ::    
        
     
        §   13-208  Extra  service  pension  credit.  Except  as  provided  in
      subdivisions a and b of section 13-206 of this subchapter:
        1. A member who shall have elected  to  contribute  on  the  basis  of
      retirement after twenty years of service, upon completing such period of
      service,  may continue in the service. In such event and upon retirement
      for service, there shall be added to his or her annual  service  pension
      one-sixtieth  of  the salary received at the date of retirement for each
      completed additional year of service, during which years such deductions
      shall have been made. Any such member upon completing twenty-five  years
      of  service,  shall  have  such  deductions made at the rate of five per
      cent, in which event and upon retirement for  service,  such  additional
      amounts also shall be added to his or her annual service pension for the
      years  during  which deductions shall have been made at the rate of five
      per cent.
        2. A member who shall have elected  to  contribute  on  the  basis  of
      retirement  after  twenty-five  years  of  service, upon completing such
      period of service, may continue in the  service.  In  such  event  there
      shall  be added to his or her annual service pension upon retirement for
      service one-sixtieth of the salary received at the  date  of  retirement
      for  each  completed additional year of service, during which years such
      deductions shall have been made at the rate of five per cent.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 13-209
--------------

Section 13-209 ::    
        
     
        §  13-209  Payment of pensions; death. a. The board of trustees of the
      pension fund shall pay a pension out of such fund to the  spouse,  child
      or children or dependent parent or parents of any deceased member of the
      police  force  in  such  department,  if  the death of such member occur
      during his or her service in such police force, or after he or  she  was
      retired from service in such force. The amount of any such pension to be
      paid  by the board of trustees to each of the several representatives of
      such member, in case there shall be more than one, from  time  to  time,
      may  be  determined by such board according to the circumstances of each
      case. The annual pension to the  representative  or  representatives  of
      such  member, however, shall be six hundred dollars, and no part of such
      sum shall be paid to any such  spouse  who  shall  remarry,  after  such
      remarriage,  or  to  any  child  after  it shall have reached the age of
      eighteen years.
        In lieu of the aforementioned pension, when a member of the force dies
      while in active service, his  or  her  beneficiary  shall  be  paid  the
      accumulated  deductions  of  such deceased member if written application
      therefor be made to the board of trustees by such beneficiary.
        b. In case any member in the police force of such department is killed
      while actually engaged in the performance of duty, or if  death  ensues,
      or results from a disease, as the immediate effect of injuries received,
      the board of trustees of such fund, upon evidence submitted to it, shall
      have  power  to  decide whether death so occurred and upon such decision
      shall award to the spouse of such member an annual sum as a pension,  to
      be  paid  out  of such fund in an amount not to exceed, except as herein
      provided, one-half of the salary of such member at the date  of  his  or
      her  decease.  If  such member, dying, leaves no spouse surviving him or
      her, but leaves a child or children, under the age of eighteen years, or
      dependent parent or  parents,  such  board  shall  award  to  the  legal
      guardian  of such child or children, or dependent parent or parents, for
      its or their support and maintenance, an annual sum as a pension out  of
      such  fund,  in  an  amount not to exceed one-half of the salary of such
      member at the date of his or her decease. The amount of such pension  to
      any  spouse shall cease upon his or her death. Such annual pension shall
      cease upon the death or marriage of such child, or upon its reaching the
      age of eighteen years. If such payment to the spouse of any such  member
      shall  cease  by  reason  of  his  or  her  death, such board shall make
      payments to the child or children, or dependent  parent  or  parents  of
      such  member,  if  any,  as  though he or she had died without leaving a
      spouse surviving him or her.
        c. The board of trustees, subject to  the  separate  approval  of  the
      mayor,  may  presume a member or former member of the pension fund to be
      dead, if such member has disappeared and has been absent for three years
      or more, unless there be affirmative evidence that he or she  was  alive
      within  that  time.  In the case of a former member who has disappeared,
      has been absent for three years or more and who was  last  known  to  be
      alive while a member of the police force in the department, the board of
      trustees,  subject  to  the  separate approval of the mayor, may presume
      that death occurred while such former member was a member of such police
      force, unless there be affirmative evidence that he  or  she  was  alive
      after  his or her separation from service in the police force. If in its
      judgment  the  evidence  warrants  such  determination,  the  board   of
      trustees,  subject  to  the  separate approval of the mayor, may make an
      additional and separate finding that such presumed death occurred  while
      such  member or former member was actually engaged in the performance of
      duty. In the event that the board of  trustees,  upon  approval  of  the
      mayor, shall take action pursuant to a presumption of death with respect
      to  the disappearance of a former member of the police force, the police
    
      commissioner shall have power to revoke any  disciplinary  action,  with
      respect  to the absence of such former member of the police force, which
      was taken by him or her after  the  date  when  such  former  member  is
      presumed  to  have died. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
      board of trustees and the police commissioner shall have power to revoke
      or rescind any action taken by  them,  respectively,  pursuant  to  this
      subdivision,  with or without cause at any time prior to five years from
      the date  of  the  disappearance  of  a  member  or  former  member  and
      thereafter  they  may  take  action and exercise such power in the event
      that they respectively shall determine,  on  the  basis  of  affirmative
      evidence  submitted  to them, that any member or former member was alive
      after the date he or she was presumed to be dead. Upon the expiration of
      a period of five years from the date of the disappearance of a member or
      former member, continuation of the payment of a pension pursuant to this
      section based upon the presumed death of such member  or  former  member
      shall  be  conditioned  upon  a  determination  by  a court of competent
      jurisdiction,  in  an  action  or  special  proceeding  brought   by   a
      beneficiary receiving all or part of such pension or any other member of
      the family of such member or former member pursuant to the provisions of
      section 2-1.7 of the estates, powers and trusts law, that such member or
      former member is presumed to be dead. Such determination shall be deemed
      conclusive  for  the  purposes  of  this  section, unless such member or
      former member thereafter shall be found to be alive.
        d. (1)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  b  of  this
      section,  in  any  case  where  a  pension  was  or is awarded under the
      provisions of such subdivision, or any predecessor provision  by  reason
      of  the  death of any such member, occurring before July first, nineteen
      hundred and sixty-five, such  pension,  subject  to  the  provisions  of
      paragraphs two and three of this subdivision d, shall consist:
        (a)  For each full calendar year, on and after January first, nineteen
      hundred and sixty-five, of a sum as a pension to be  paid  out  of  such
      fund and in an amount not to exceed, except as herein provided, one-half
      of  the  annual  salary or compensation payable, on July first, nineteen
      hundred and sixty-five, to a member of  the  uniformed  force  of  rank,
      seniority,  and  other  salary-determining  status, equal to that of the
      deceased member on the date of his or her decease but in  no  case  less
      than  one-half  of the salary payable to a first grade patrolman on July
      first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and
        (b) For any portion of a calendar year, on and  after  January  first,
      nineteen hundred and sixty-five, the appropriate pro rata portion of the
      amount  which would be payable, under the provisions of subparagraph (a)
      of this paragraph one, for the full calendar year  which  includes  such
      portion  of  a  year, if a pension were payable under this subdivision d
      for such full calendar year.
        (2) Such pension shall be payable to the same  persons  and  shall  be
      subject  to  the  same  terms and conditions, including provisions as to
      termination, as to the pension which would otherwise be payable, on  and
      after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  and  sixty-five,  pursuant to
      subdivision b of this section or any applicable  predecessor  provision,
      by reason of the death of such member.
        (3)  The  pension payable pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs one
      and two of this subdivision d shall be in  lieu  of  any  pension  which
      would  otherwise  be payable on or after January first, nineteen hundred
      and sixty-five pursuant to the provisions  of  such  subdivision  b,  or
      predecessor  provision,  and,  except as otherwise provided in paragraph
      one of subdivision e of section 13-686 of this title, shall be  in  lieu
      of  any  supplemental  retirement  allowance  which  would  otherwise be
    
      payable, on and after such date, under the provisions of subchapter  six
      of chapter five of this title or any other law.

      cent. or six per cent. deductions without interest made from his or  her
