      thirty-one  of  chapter  two of title twenty of the code who has removed

      service  fee of not more than one-half of the charge allowed for removal
      as provided in paragraph eight of this subdivision, for which a  receipt
      shall be given.
        6.  The registered owner or other person in control of a vehicle which
      has been removed pursuant to  this  section  shall  have  the  right  to
      inspect the vehicle before accepting its return. No release or waiver of
      any  kind which would release the person or company removing the vehicle
      from liability for damages may be required from any such owner or  other
      person  as  a  condition  of  release  of  the vehicle to such person. A
      detailed, signed receipt showing the legal name of the person or company

      commissioner of parks and recreation.
        c.  No  person less than fourteen years of age shall operate a scooter
      unless such person is wearing a helmet  meeting  the  standards  of  the
      American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI  Z  90.4  bicycle helmet

        d. It is a traffic  infraction  to  violate  the  provisions  of  this
      section punishable, upon conviction, by a civil penalty of not more than
      fifty dollars. Such traffic infractions shall be heard and determined in
      accordance  with  article  2-A of the vehicle and traffic law. A hearing
      officer shall waive the civil penalty for which the parent  or  guardian
      of  a person who violates the provisions of this section would be liable

      violation  and  the  appearance  date  for such violation such parent or
      guardian purchased or rented a helmet that  meets  the  requirements  of
      this  section.  A  hearing officer may waive the civil penalty for which
      the parent or guardian of a person who violates the provisions  of  this
      section  would  be  liable  if  he  or  she finds that due to reasons of
      economic hardship such parent or guardian was unable to purchase or rent
      a helmet. A waiver of the civil penalty shall not apply to a  second  or
      subsequent conviction under this section.
        e.  The parent or guardian of a person less than fourteen years of age
      shall be liable for a violation of this section by such person less than

      person  less  than  fourteen  years  of  age shall only be issued to the
      parent or guardian of  such  person  if  the  violation  occurs  in  the
      presence of such parent or guardian and where such parent or guardian is
      eighteen years of age or more. Such summons shall only be issued to such
      parent  or  guardian  and  shall  not  be issued to the person less than
      fourteen years of age.
        f. The failure of any person to comply with  the  provisions  of  this
      section  shall  not  constitute contributory negligence or assumption of
      risk, and shall not in any way bar, preclude or foreclose an action  for
      personal injury or wrongful death by or on behalf of such person, nor in
      any way diminish or reduce the damages recoverable in any such action.
        g.  The  department  of  health  and  mental  hygiene shall distribute
      informational materials through the department's school health  program,
      which  shall  include  information  explaining  the hazards of operating
      scooters without  protective  headgear.  These  informational  materials
      shall  be  printed  in multiple languages and shall be made available to
      any member of the public upon request.
    
        h. The police department and the department of  parks  and  recreation

        §  19-175.2  Notification  of  changes  in  parking  restrictions.  a.
      Following any permanent change in parking  restrictions  posted  by  the
      department,  the  department  shall  post notice, in the affected areas,
      indicating the effective date of  such  change.  An  owner  of  a  motor
      vehicle  parked in the affected areas who receives a notice of a parking
      violation that occurred within five days of posting of the notice of the
      parking restriction change shall have an affirmative  defense  that  the
      vehicle  of  the  owner  was  parked  in  compliance with the applicable
      parking restriction that was in effect prior to such change. Within  one
      business  day of making a permanent change in parking restrictions, such
      change will be reflected on the website containing parking  restrictions
      as required by section 19-175.1 of the code.
        b.  Before  the department makes temporary parking restriction changes
      to conduct road repairs, it shall post notice of the effective  date  of
      such  restrictions  as soon as practicable. Such notice shall state that
      no notice of violations shall be issued for violations of such temporary
      parking restrictions and that if an owner's  motor  vehicle  is  missing
      from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the
      motor  vehicle  owner  should  contact  the  local  police  precinct for
      information about the location of such motor vehicle.
        c. Following the issuance by the office of the mayor of a permit  that
      authorizes  filming  and/or  related  activity and that provides special
      parking privileges or the temporary suspension of parking  restrictions,
      the party to whom the permit is issued shall post notice of such parking
      restriction  changes  immediately  in  the  affected  areas. Such notice
      shall,  at  a  minimum,  state  the  temporary  change  in  the  parking
      restrictions,  the  date  on which such change will take effect, that no
      notice of violations shall be issued for  violations  of  the  temporary
      parking  restrictions  and  that  if an owner's motor vehicle is missing
      from the affected streets, the motor vehicle may have been towed and the
      motor vehicle  owner  should  contact  the  local  police  precinct  for
      information about the location of such motor vehicle.
        d.  Following the issuance by the office of the mayor of a permit that
      authorizes a sponsor to  conduct  a  street  fair  or  parade  and  that
      provides  special  parking  privileges  or  the  temporary suspension of
      parking restrictions, the sponsor shall  post  notice  of  such  parking
      restriction  changes  on  a form provided by the office of the mayor, in
      the affected areas, at least seven days prior to the date on which  such
      change  will  take  effect.  Such  notice shall, at a minimum, state the
      temporary change in the parking restrictions and  the  date  the  change
      will take effect.
        e.  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  require  the
      department or any applicable city agency to provide notice of  temporary
      parking restriction changes when required to preserve public safety.
