      inspection for a taxicab, inclusive of the issuance of such certificate,

      agency authorized by law may conduct on-street inspections  of  vehicles
      licensed  pursuant  to  the  provisions of this chapter. The date of the
      inspection of a taxicab and the signature  of  the  persons  making  the
      inspection  shall  be  recorded upon the rate card in the space provided
      therefor. An owner shall be ordered  by  the  commission  to  repair  or
      replace  his  or her licensed vehicle where it appears that it no longer
      meets the reasonable standards for  safe  operation  prescribed  by  the
      commission.  Upon  failure  of  such  owner  to  have his or her vehicle
      inspected or to comply with any such order within ten days after service
      thereof, the license shall be suspended; upon failure of such  owner  to
      comply  with any such order within one hundred twenty days after service
      thereof, the license may, at the discretion of the commission, be deemed
      to have been abandoned by nonuser.
        g. The commission shall revoke any license for nonuse in the event  it
      shall  determine  that  the  vehicle  has  not  been  operated for sixty
      consecutive days, provided that such failure to operate shall  not  have
      been  caused  by  strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe or other
      act beyond the control of the owner; or in the event the owner has  sold
      his  or  her  vehicle  and  has failed to replace the vehicle within one
      hundred and twenty days from the date of sale.  However,  in  the  event
      that  it  is  shown  to  the  commission  by  competent  proof  that  an
      owner-driver has been disabled through illness, his or her license shall
      not be revoked because of such nonuse as provided in this subdivision.
        h. A medallion or license may  be  transferred  from  one  vehicle  to
      another,  subject  to the approval of the commission and upon payment of
      such fee as the commission  shall  require,  but  not  to  exceed  fifty
      dollars.  A  vehicle  licensee may change the base communications system
      with which it is affiliated, subject to the approval of  the  commission
      and upon payment of such fee as the commission shall require, but not to
      exceed fifty dollars.

      total number of taxicab licenses held by owners of more than one taxicab

      one  taxicab  license, shall remain the same as it exists at the time of
      the enactment of this section unless or until changed by local law.
        j. The commission  shall  replace  the  medallion  for  every  taxicab
      license  which is renewed pursuant to this section once every two years,
      or more frequently at the discretion of the commission.  The  commission
    
      may  charge  a  fee  not  to  exceed  ten  dollars  for each replacement
      medallion.
        k.  The  commission may charge a fee not to exceed twenty-five dollars
      per vehicle for the replacement of license plates issued by the New York
      state department of motor vehicles.

      shall  be  fingerprinted  for  the  purpose of securing criminal history
      records from the  state  division  of  criminal  justice  services.  The
      applicant shall pay any processing fee required by the state division of
      criminal justice services. Fingerprints shall be taken of the individual
      owner if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; the general partners if
      the   applicant   is   a  partnership;  the  officers,  principals,  and
      stockholders owning more than ten percent of the  outstanding  stock  of
      the corporation if the applicant is a corporation.
        m.  The  commission  shall  approve or disapprove an application for a
      commuter van license within  one  hundred  and  eighty  days  after  the
      completed  application  is  filed.  The failure to approve or disapprove
      such  completed  application  within  such  time  shall  be   deemed   a
      disapproval of such application.
        n.  Every  commuter  van license shall be issued on the condition that
      the applicant is in  compliance  with  the  registration  and  insurance
      requirements set forth in section 19-504.3 of this chapter and any rules
      promulgated  pursuant  thereto  during  the time that such license is in
      effect. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law,  the  failure  to
      comply  with  either  such  registration or insurance requirements shall
      render the commuter van license suspended on and after the date of  such
      noncompliance  and  during  the  period  of  such noncompliance, and any
      person using such commuter van in the course of operations of a commuter
      van service during such period of noncompliance shall be  deemed  to  be
      operating without a license required by this section.
        o.  The  annual license fee for each commuter van license shall be two
      hundred seventy-five dollars. Commencing two years  after  the  date  of
      enactment  of  the  local  law  that  added this subdivision, the annual
      license fee for each commuter van  shall  be  an  amount  equal  to  the
      license  fee  for  a for-hire vehicle set forth in subdivision b of this
      section, as it may be amended. The license fee shall be prorated to  the
      term of the license.
        p. A commuter van license shall not be transferable or assignable.
        q. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the commission shall
      not  issue or renew a taxicab license unless the applicant or holder, as
      the case may be, avows under penalty of perjury  that  such  person  has
      fully   paid  all  and  any  tax  imposed  on  such  person  by  article

      taxation and finance for confirmation that such  person  has  paid  such

Section 19-504.2 ::    
        
     
        §  19-504.2  Authorization  to  operate  a commuter van service. a. No
      person shall operate a commuter van service wholly within the boundaries
      of the city or partly within the city if the partial operation  consists
      of  the  pick  up  and  discharge  of  passengers wholly within the city
      without first obtaining authorization from the commission.
        b. The commission shall not issue or renew an authorization to operate
      a commuter  van  service  unless  the  following  conditions  have  been
      satisfied:
        (1)  the  commission determines that the applicant is fit, willing and
      able to provide the transportation for which authorization is sought;
        (2) the applicant is in compliance  with  the  provisions  of  section
      19-504.3  of  this  chapter,  and  the  applicant has not engaged in any
      conduct that would be a basis  for  suspension  or  revocation  of  such
      authorization pursuant to rules promulgated by the commission; and
        (3)  the applicant has satisfied such other criteria as the commission
      deems to be in the interest of the safety and convenience of the  public
      and necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
        c.  Prior  to the issuance or renewal of an authorization to operate a
      commuter van service, the  applicant  shall  be  fingerprinted  for  the
      purpose  of securing criminal history records from the state division of
      criminal justice services. The applicant shall pay  any  processing  fee
      required   by   the   state   division  of  criminal  justice  services.
      Fingerprints shall be taken of the individual owner if the applicant  is
      a  sole  proprietorship;  the  general  partners  if  the applicant is a
      partnership; the officers, principals, and stockholders owning more than
      ten percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation if the applicant
      is a corporation.
        d. An application for an  authorization  to  operate  a  commuter  van
      service  or  for  renewal thereof shall be made to the commission in the
      form and manner prescribed by the commission.
        e. (1) The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating  that  the
      service  proposed  will  be  required  by  the  present or future public
      convenience  and  necessity.  The  commission   shall   not   issue   an
      authorization  to operate a commuter van service unless the commissioner
      of transportation determines that the service proposed will be  required
      by  the  present  or  future  public  convenience  and  necessity.  Such
      determination that the service proposed will be required by the  present
      or  future  public  convenience and necessity shall be in effect for six
      years after the date of issuance  of  such  authorization,  unless  such
      authorization has not been renewed or has been revoked by the commission
      prior   to   the  end  of  such  six-year  period  in  which  case  such
      determination shall be in effect only until the expiration or revocation
      of such authorization.  After  the  expiration  or  revocation  of  such
      determination  of  public convenience and necessity, no authorization to
      operate  a  commuter  van  service  shall  be  renewed  unless   a   new
      determination  is  made  by  the commissioner of transportation that the
      service proposed will be  required  by  the  present  or  future  public
      convenience and necessity.
        (2) When such a determination by the commissioner of transportation is
      required  by  this  subdivision,  the  application  for authorization to
      operate a commuter van service  shall  set  forth  the  geographic  area
      proposed  to  be  served  by  the  applicant  and  the maximum number of
      vehicles to be operated and the capacity of each such vehicle,  and  the
      commission  shall forward a copy of such application to the commissioner
      of transportation.
        (3) The commissioner of transportation, after  consultation  with  the
      state  department  of transportation, shall make a determination whether
      the service proposed in the application will be required by the  present
    
      or   future  public  convenience  and  necessity.  The  commissioner  of
      transportation may request that the  applicant  provide  any  additional
      information   relevant   to  such  determination.  The  commissioner  of
      transportation  shall notify the New York city transit authority and all
      council members and community boards representing  any  portion  of  the
      geographic  area  set  forth  in  the  application  for  the  purpose of
      obtaining comment on  the  present  or  future  public  convenience  and
      necessity  for  any proposed service. The commissioner of transportation
      shall provide for publication in the City Record of a notice of any such
      application and shall allow for public comment on such application for a
      period not to exceed sixty days after the date of  publication  of  such
      notice.  If any such application is protested by a bus line operating in
      the city or by the New York city transit authority, and  such  bus  line
      and/or   transit  authority  has  timely  submitted  objections  to  the
      application to the  commissioner  of  transportation,  the  commissioner
      shall,  in  making  such  determination,  evaluate  such  objections  in
      accordance with the following criteria:
        (a) the adequacy of the existing mass transit and mass  transportation
      facilities to meet the transportation needs of any particular segment of
      the general public for the proposed service; and
        (b)  the  impact  that the proposed operation may have on any existing
      mass transit or mass transportation facilities.
        Any determination by the commissioner that a service proposed will  be
      required by the present or future public convenience and necessity shall
      specify  the  geographic area where service is authorized and the number
      of commuter vans authorized to be used in providing such service.
        f. (1) The commission, after consultation with the state department of
      transportation,  shall  approve  or  disapprove  such  application   for
      authorization  to  operate  a  commuter  van  service within one hundred
      eighty days after the date a completed application has been  filed.  The
      failure  to approve or disapprove such completed application within such
      one hundred eighty day period shall be  deemed  a  disapproval  of  such
      application.
        (2)  Any determination by the commission to approve an application for
      authorization to operate a commuter van service pursuant to this section
      shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the  council  within  five
      days  of  such  determination  being  made.  Within  twenty days of such
      submission the council may adopt a resolution by majority  vote  of  all
      council members to review that determination.
        (3)  Within thirty days of the adoption of the council of a resolution
      pursuant to this subdivision, the  council  may  act  by  local  law  to
      approve  or disapprove the determination of the commission. In the event
      that the council fails to act by local law within the thirty day  period
      provided for in this paragraph the determination of the commission shall
      remain in effect.
        g.  An authorization to operate a commuter van service shall be issued
      for a term of not less than one nor more than two years and shall expire
      on the date set forth in such authorization unless sooner  suspended  or
      revoked by the commission.
        h. The commission shall not issue a temporary authorization to operate
      a  commuter  van  service.  An  authorization  to operate a commuter van
      service shall  not  be  assignable  or  transferable,  unless  otherwise
      provided by the commission.
        i.  In  the  event  of  the  loss,  mutilation  or  destruction of any
      authorization to operate a commuter van service  the  owner  shall  file
      such  statement  and  proof  of the facts as the commission may require,
      with a fee not to exceed twenty-five dollars for each authorization,  at
    
      the  offices of the commission, and the commission may issue a duplicate
      or substitute authorization.
        j.  No application for authorization to operate a commuter van service
      shall be approved if the applicant has been found guilty of operating  a
      commuter  van service without authorization to operate such commuter van
      service two times within  a  six-month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
      application,  provided  that  such violations were committed on or after
      the  date  occurring  six  months  after  the  effective  date  of  this
      subdivision.
        k.(i)   Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  section,  no
      application for authorization to operate  a  commuter  van  service,  to
      increase  the  number  of  commuter  vans that a commuter van service is
      authorized to operate, to increase the number of hours  during  which  a
      commuter van service may operate or to modify the territory within which
      a  commuter  van service may operate, other than an application to renew
      an authorization to operate a commuter van service, shall be accepted or
      processed and no pending application, other than an application to renew
      an authorization to operate a commuter van service, shall be approved by
      the commission for a period of one year from the effective date of  this
      paragraph.
        (ii) The department of city planning shall submit to the mayor and the
      council  copies of the final report reflecting the results of a commuter
      van service policy study currently being conducted under the auspices of
      the department of city planning,  or  any  similar  study,  within  five
      business days of its completion.

      relationship  to  such person's fitness or ability to perform any of the

      provide a basis for the commission to refuse to renew, or to suspend  or
      revoke, such authorization or license; or
        (5) the holder of an authorization or a license has failed to maintain
      the  conditions  of operation applicable to the particular authorization

      accommodations  in the operation of a commuter van service or a commuter
      van.
        d. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the  chairperson  of  the
      commission  may  immediately  suspend  any  authorization  to  operate a
      commuter van service or commuter van license or  commuter  van  driver's
      license  issued  under  this  chapter  without a prior hearing where the
      chairperson  determines  that   the   continued   possession   of   such
      authorization  or  license  poses a serious danger to the public health,
      safety or welfare, provided that after such  suspension  an  opportunity
      for  a  hearing shall be provided on an expedited basis, within a period
      not to exceed fourteen days.
        e. Where the  commission  suspends  or  revokes  an  authorization  to
      operate a commuter van service pursuant to this section:
        (1)  any  commuter  van  license which has been issued as part of such
      authorization shall be deemed suspended or revoked, as the case may  be,
      where  the  suspension  or  revocation of the authorization to operate a
      commuter van service was based, in whole or in part, upon the  operation
      of such commuter van; or
        (2)  any  commuter  van  license which has been issued as part of such
      authorization shall continue to be valid in accordance  with  its  terms
      where  the  suspension  or  revocation of the authorization to operate a
      commuter van service was not based,  in  whole  or  in  part,  upon  the
      operation  of  such  commuter van; provided, however, that such commuter
      van shall not be operated in the course of operations of  such  commuter
      van  service  unless  and  until such commuter van operates as part of a
      current,  valid  authorization  to  operate  a  commuter  van   service;
      provided,  further  that  any  such  commuter van which operates without
      being part of a current, valid authorization to operate a  commuter  van
      service  shall  be deemed to be operating without a commuter van license
      and shall be subject to any and all of the penalties that may be imposed
      under this chapter  for  the  unlicensed  operation  of  commuter  vans,
      including  seizure  and  forfeiture as provided in sections 19-529.2 and
      19-529.3 of this chapter.
        f. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who has  had
      an  authorization  to  operate  a  commuter  van  service revoked by the
    
      commission pursuant to this section shall not be permitted to apply  for
      an  authorization  to  operate a commuter van service under this chapter
      for a period of six months after the date of such revocation.
        g.  The  commission  shall  notify  the  holder of an authorization to
      operate a commuter van service of all violations issued to any driver or
      vehicle operating pursuant to such authorization.

      shall drive any motor  vehicle  for  hire  which  is  regulated  by  the
      provisions of this chapter without first obtaining from the commission:
        (i) a taxicab driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a taxicab; or
        (ii) a coach driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a coach; or
        (iii)  a for-hire vehicle driver's license, if the vehicle driven is a
      for-hire vehicle; or
        (iv) a wheelchair accessible van  driver's  license,  if  the  vehicle
      driven is a wheelchair accessible van; or
        (v)  a  commuter  van  driver's  license,  if  the vehicle driven is a
      commuter van.
        The issuance of a license  to  a  person  to  drive  any  one  of  the
      aforementioned  licensed vehicles shall not entitle such person to drive
      any other such licensed vehicle without first obtaining  the  additional
      appropriate driver's license.
        b.  Each  applicant  for a license, other than a commuter van driver's
      license, must:
        1. Hold a New York state chauffeur's license.
        2. Be nineteen years of age or over.
        3. Be of sound physical condition with good eyesight and no  epilepsy,
      vertigo,  heart  trouble  or  any  other infirmity of body or mind which
      might render him or her unfit for  the  safe  operation  of  a  licensed
      vehicle.
        4. Be fingerprinted.
        5. Be of good moral character.
        6. Not be addicted to the use of drugs or intoxicating liquors.
        c. Applications for driver's licenses must be filed as directed by the
      commission,  and  must  be accompanied by the required license fee. Such
      application shall be on a form provided by the  commission  and  contain
      such information as the commission deems reasonably necessary.
        d.  Each applicant for a driver's license under the provisions of this
      chapter, other than a commuter van driver's license, shall  be  examined
      as  to  his  or  her  physical  condition  by  a duly licensed physician
      designated by the commission; each such applicant shall also be examined
      by the commission as to his or her knowledge of the  city,  as  well  as
      city  and  state laws governing the idling of engines, and if the result
      of any of these examinations is  unsatisfactory,  he  or  she  shall  be
      refused a license.
        e.  Each  applicant  for  a driver's license must file with his or her
      application two recent photos of such applicant of a size which  may  be
      easily attached to his or her license, one of which shall be attached to
      the  license when issued and the other filed with the application in the
      office of the commission.
        f. Upon satisfactory fulfillment of the applicable requirements, there
      shall be issued to the applicant a driver's license which  shall  be  in
      such form as the commission may direct.
        g.  Original driver's licenses and renewals thereof shall be valid for
      a period of not less than one year nor more than three years.
        h. The commission may renew a driver's  license  provided  the  driver
      shall  have  made  application  on the prescribed form during the period
      which the commission shall designate, and the commission may require the
      same standards and tests as are applicable for original applications.
        i. The commission may revoke any driver's license for nonuse,  in  the
      event  it  shall  determine  that  the  driver  has  not worked at least
      twenty-five days as a licensed driver in the calendar year preceding the
      calendar year in which such determination is made,  provided  that  such
      failure  to  work  as  a  licensed  driver shall not have been caused by
      strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe.  However,  in  the  event
    
      that  it is shown to the commission by competent proof that a driver has
      been disabled through illness, his or her license shall not  be  revoked
      because of such nonuse as provided in this subdivision.
        j.  Fees  shall  be  paid by each applicant for a driver's license, as
      determined by the commission, but not to exceed the following: For  each
      original  one-year  license  $ 84.00. For renewal of a one year period $
      84.00. The fee for an original license or a  renewal  thereof  shall  be
      paid at the time of filing the applications and shall not be refunded in
      the  event  of  disapproval  of  the  application. An additional fee not
      exceeding twenty-five dollars shall be paid for each license  issued  to
      replace a lost or mutilated license. There shall be an additional fee of
      twenty-five  dollars  for  late  filing of a license renewal application
      where such late filing is permitted by the commission.
        k. Every driver who has obtained a license pursuant  to  this  section
      shall   comply  with  the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by  the
      commission for drivers of the type of vehicle for which  the  driver  is
      licensed.
        l. The commission may, after a hearing, suspend or revoke any driver's
      license  for  failure  to  comply  with  any  provision  of this chapter
      applicable to licensed  drivers  or  for  failure  to  comply  with  the
      commission's rules and regulations.
        m. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission
      shall  not  issue a commuter van driver's license to an applicant unless
      the applicant: (1) has been fingerprinted for the  purpose  of  securing
      criminal  history  records  from  the state division of criminal justice
      services for which the applicant shall pay any processing  fee  required
      by  the  state  division of criminal justice services; (2) satisfies the
      commission that such applicant is fit and able to drive the commuter van
      for which the license is sought; (3)  possesses  a  commercial  driver's
      license  which  pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law is valid for the
      operation of such commuter van  for  the  transportation  of  passengers
      for-hire; (4) has met the qualifications set forth in article nineteen-A
      of  the vehicle and traffic law for the operation of a bus as defined in
      such article; and (5) has not engaged in any conduct  that  would  be  a
      basis  for  suspension  or  revocation of such license pursuant to rules
      promulgated by the commission.
        n. The commission shall approve or disapprove an application  for  the
      issuance  of  a  commuter van driver's license within one hundred eighty
      days after the completed application is filed. The failure to approve or
      disapprove  such  application  within  such  time  shall  be  deemed   a
      disapproval of such application.
        o.  Every  commuter  van  driver's  license  shall  be  issued  on the
      condition that the applicant possesses a commercial driver's license and
      complies with article nineteen-A of  the  vehicle  and  traffic  law  as
      described  in paragraphs three and four of subdivision m of this section
      during the time that such commuter van driver's license  is  in  effect.
      Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, suspension or revocation of
      such commercial driver's license pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law
      or noncompliance with article nineteen-A of the vehicle and traffic  law
      shall  render  the  commuter van driver's license suspended on and after
      the date of the suspension or revocation  of  such  commercial  driver's
      license  or  noncompliance  with  such article nineteen-A and during the
      period of such suspension, revocation or noncompliance, and  any  person
      who  drives  a  commuter van that is required to be licensed pursuant to
      section 19-504 of this chapter during the  period  of  such  suspension,
      revocation or noncompliance shall be deemed to be driving a commuter van
      without a license required by this section.
    
        p.  Any  commuter van driver's license issued pursuant to this section
      shall be revoked after the holder of such license has had an opportunity
      for a hearing in accordance with procedures to  be  established  by  the
      commission  and  such  holder  is  found  to  have failed to comply with
      paragraph two of subdivision a of section 19-529.1 of this chapter three
      times within a period of six months.
        q.  Not  more  than one hundred eighty days following the enactment of
      this subdivision, the commission shall develop and commence a program to
      notify  drivers  of  all  vehicles  licensed  by  the  commission   that
      facilitating  sex  trafficking  with  a vehicle is illegal. Such program
      shall inform such drivers of the specific laws defining and  proscribing
      such  facilitation, including the provisions of this section and section
      19-507 of this chapter, and of article 230 of the penal law,  and  shall
      inform  such drivers of the civil and criminal penalties associated with
      such facilitation, including but  not  limited  to  monetary  penalties,
      license  revocation  and  incarceration. Such program shall also provide
      information to such drivers about  the  resources  available  to  assist
      victims  of sex trafficking. Such program shall also inform such drivers
      that they may not refuse fares solely based  on  the  appearance  of  an
      individual  and  that  it  is  unlawful  to  refuse a fare based upon an
      individual's actual or perceived sexual orientation or  gender,  whether
      or not an individual's gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior
      or  expression  is different from that traditionally associated with the
      legal sex assigned to an individual at birth, as set  forth  in  chapter
      one  of  title eight of this code. Such program may be presented through
      live instruction, video or an interactive computer course, and shall  be
      updated   regularly   to  reflect  changes  in  law  or  other  relevant
      circumstances. Completion of such program shall  be  a  requirement  for
      initial  licensure  and  subsequent  license  renewal  for such drivers,
      except that any driver who has completed such program at least once  may
      subsequently  satisfy  the  requirements  of  this  subdivision,  at the
      discretion of the commission, by  reviewing  written  materials,  to  be
      developed  by  the  commission,  that  contain  the  information in such
      program. All drivers licensed by the commission  shall  be  required  to
      certify  that  they have completed such program or received and reviewed
      such written materials.

Section 19-506 ::    
        
     
        §  19-506  Regulations  and  enforcement.    a.  Except as provided by
      section 19-512.1, the commission  may  impose  reasonable  fines  and/or
      suspend  or revoke any license issued by the commission where the holder
      has failed to comply with or has willfully or knowingly violated any  of
      the provisions of this chapter or a rule or regulation of the commission
      after  adjudication  of  such  violation  by the administrative tribunal
      established by the commission in accordance with section 2303 of the New
      York city charter.
        b. 1. Except as provided in  paragraph  2  of  this  subdivision,  any
      person  who  shall  permit  another  to  operate  or who shall knowingly
      operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle as  a  taxicab,  coach,
      wheelchair accessible van, HAIL vehicle or for-hire vehicle in the city,
      without  first  having  obtained  or knowing that another has obtained a
      license for such vehicle pursuant to the provisions of section 19-504 of
      this chapter, shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction in the
      criminal court shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand
      dollars or more than two thousand dollars or imprisonment for  not  more
      than  sixty  days,  or  both  such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph
      shall apply to the owner of such  vehicle  and,  if  different,  to  the
      operator of such vehicle.
        2.  Any  person  who  shall  permit  another  to  operate or who shall
      knowingly operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle licensed as a
      taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible  van,  HAIL  vehicle  or  for-hire
      vehicle  in  the  city  in  a  manner  that  is  beyond the scope of the
      activities permitted by such vehicle's license  shall  be  guilty  of  a
      violation,  and  upon conviction in the criminal court shall be punished
      by a fine of not less than  four  hundred  dollars  nor  more  than  one
      thousand  dollars,  or imprisonment for not more than sixty days or both
      such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph shall apply to the  owner  of
      such vehicle and, if different, to the operator of such vehicle.
        3.  Where  a  violation  of  this  chapter  or  any  rules promulgated
      thereunder is committed using a vehicle  which  is  owned  by  a  rental
      vehicle  company  and  has  been rented or leased by such rental vehicle
      company, it shall be an affirmative  defense  that  the  rental  vehicle
      company  did not know or have any reason to know that the person to whom
      it was rented or leased would operate or offer to operate for hire  such
      vehicle  as  a  taxicab,  coach,  wheelchair  accessible van or for-hire
      vehicle in the city. For purposes of this subdivision, a "rental vehicle
      company"  shall  be  defined  as  any  person  or  organization  or  any
      subsidiary  or  affiliate,  including  a  franchise,  in the business of
      providing rental vehicles to the public.
        c. (1) No person shall operate or permit to be  operated  any  vehicle
      bearing  the  words "hack," "taxi," "taxicab," "cab," "coach," "for-hire
      vehicle," "livery," "limousine," "commuter van service," "van  service,"
      "commuter  van," "van" or other designation of similar import unless the
      vehicle is licensed as a taxicab, coach, for-hire vehicle,  or  commuter
      van,  as appropriate, and the driver has an appropriate driver's license
      under this chapter, and in the case of  a  commuter  van  service,  such
      person has an authorization to operate a commuter van service, nor shall
      any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as
      a  taxi, taxicab, hack or coach service unless he or she holds a vehicle
      license and medallion for each vehicle  used  therefor,  nor  shall  any
      person  advertise  or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a
      "limousine service," "livery service," a "for-hire vehicle service,"  or
      other similar designation unless a for-hire vehicle license is in effect
      for  each  vehicle used therefor, nor shall any person advertise or hold
      himself or herself out as doing business as a  "commuter  van  service,"
      "van  service,"  "commuter  van,"  "van" or other designation of similar
    
      import unless such person  is  authorized  to  operate  a  commuter  van
      service  and  a  commuter van license is in effect for each vehicle used
      therefor as required by this chapter, nor shall any person advertise  or
      hold himself or herself out as doing business as a wheelchair accessible
      van  service or other similar designation unless a wheelchair accessible
      van license is in effect for each vehicle used therefor.
        (2) Any person required to obtain a license under this  chapter  shall
      conspicuously state in all print and broadcast advertising, with respect
      to  such  licensed  activity,  the  vehicle  license number and that the
      activity is licensed by  the  commission;  provided,  however,  that  as
      applied  to  the owner of a for-hire vehicle base station, or wheelchair
      accessible van base station, such license number shall be the number  of
      the  license  issued  to  such  base station; provided further, that the
      requirement of  this  subdivision  respecting  the  display  of  vehicle
      license  numbers  in  print and broadcast advertising shall not apply to
      any owner of five or more taxicabs. No person who is required to  obtain
      authorization to operate a commuter van service under this chapter shall
      advertise  in  print  or  in  a  broadcast medium the activity for which
      authorization  is  required  without  conspicuously  stating   in   such
      advertising  the  commuter van service authorization number and that the
      activity is licensed by the commission.
        d. Any person, other than a person holding a driver's  license  issued
      pursuant  to  section  19-505  and  a  New York state class A, B, C or E
      license, neither of  which  is  revoked  or  suspended,  who  drives  or
      operates  for hire a licensed vehicle in the city except a commuter van,
      shall be guilty of a violation, and  upon  conviction  in  the  criminal
      court, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars
      nor  more  than  one  thousand  dollars  or  imprisonment for a term not
      exceeding thirty days, or both such fine and imprisonment.
        e. (1) In addition to or as an alternative to the  penalties  provided
      for the violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision b or
      subdivision  d  of  this  section,  any  person  who  shall violate such
      provisions shall, for the first violation, be liable for a civil penalty
      of one thousand five hundred  dollars,  and  for  the  second  violation
      committed  within  a thirty six month period, for a civil penalty of two
      thousand dollars.
        (2) As an alternative to the penalties provided for the  violation  of
      the  provisions  of  paragraph  two of subdivision b or subdivision c of
      this section, any person who shall  violate  such  provisions  shall  be
      liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars nor more
      than one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation.
        (3)  A  proceeding  to impose a civil penalty prescribed in paragraphs
      one or two of this subdivision or in subdivision f of this section shall
      be commenced by the service of a notice of violation  returnable  before
      the  commission  or  an  administrative  tribunal of the commission. The
      commission or such tribunal, after a hearing as provided by the rules of
      the commission or its successor agency, shall have the power to  enforce
      its  decisions  and orders imposing such civil penalties as if they were
      money judgments pursuant to subdivision c of section two thousand  three
      hundred three of the charter.
        f.  As  an  alternative to the penalties provided for the violation of
      subdivision c of this section, the commission, after notice and hearing,
      shall be authorized to impose  the  civil  penalties  provided  in  this
      subdivision  upon  any  person found to have advertised in print or in a
      broadcast medium in violation of such  subdivision,  provided,  however,
      that  such  civil penalties may be imposed only when such person was not
      licensed by the commission at the time of such violation. Such penalties
      shall be levied for each broadcast in violation of such subdivision  and
    
      shall  be  not  less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred
      fifty dollars for  each  such  broadcast.  Such  penalties  for  printed
      advertisements  shall  be  levied  for  each  publication  and  shall be
      determined  based  on  the  period  of time the publication in which the
      advertisement appears remains  current.  The  current  period  shall  be
      determined as that time when a publication is initially offered for sale
      or  distribution  until  the  period  when the next dated publication is
      offered for sale or distribution. In no case shall this period  be  less
      than twenty-four hours. If the current period is:
        daily,  such  penalty  shall  be not less than one hundred dollars nor
      more than five hundred dollars per day;
        weekly, such penalty shall be not less than two hundred fifty  dollars
      nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars;
        greater  than one week and not more than one month, such penalty shall
      be not less than seven hundred fifty dollars nor more than one  thousand
      dollars; and
        greater  than  one  month,  such  penalty  shall  be not less than one
      thousand dollars nor more than two thousand dollars.
        g. The commission shall undertake a public awareness campaign advising
      the public to patronize only licensed  taxicabs  and  for-hire  vehicles
      and, when selecting a taxicab or for-hire vehicle from an advertisement,
      to look for the commission license number in any such advertisement.
        h.  (1)  Any  officer  or employee of the commission designated by the
      chairperson of the commission and  any  police  officer  may  seize  any
      vehicle  which  he  or  she has probable cause to believe is operated or
      offered to be  operated  without  a  vehicle  license  in  violation  of
      paragraph one of subdivision b of this section or without an appropriate
      vehicle  license  for  such  operation  in violation of paragraph two of
      subdivision b or of subdivision c or  subdivision  k  of  this  section.
      Therefore,  either  the  commission or an administrative tribunal of the
      commission at a proceeding commenced in accordance with subdivision e of
      this section, or the criminal court, as provided in this section,  shall
      determine  whether  a  vehicle  seized  pursuant to this subdivision was
      operated or offered to be operated in violation of any such subdivision.
      The commission shall have the power to promulgate regulations concerning
      the seizure and release of vehicles and may provide in such  regulations
      for reasonable fees for the removal and storage of such vehicles. Unless
      the  charge  of  violating  subdivision  b,  c  or  k of this section is
      dismissed, no vehicle seized  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be
      released  until all fees for removal and storage and the applicable fine
      or civil penalty have been paid or a bond has been posted in a form  and
      amount  satisfactory  to the commission, except as is otherwise provided
      for vehicles subject to forfeiture pursuant to  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision.
        (2)  In  addition  to any other penalties provided in this section, if
      the owner is convicted in the criminal court  of,  or  found  liable  in
      accordance  with  subdivision  e  of  this  section  for, a violation of
      paragraphs  one  or  two  of  subdivision  b  or  of  subdivision  c  or
      subdivision  k  of  this  section  two  or  more  times, and all of such
      violations were committed on or after the effective date of this section
      and within a thirty-six month period, the interest of such owner in  any
      vehicle  used  in  the  commission  of  any  such  second  or subsequent
      violation shall be  subject  to  forfeiture  upon  notice  and  judicial
      determination.  Notice  of  the institution of the forfeiture proceeding
      shall be in accordance with the provisions of the civil practice law and
      rules. The penalties provided for in this paragraph shall also apply  to
      any owner who has been convicted of or found liable for one violation of
      paragraphs  one  or  two  of  subdivision  b  or  of  subdivision  c  or
    
      subdivision k of this section at the time the local law that added  this
      paragraph   was   enacted  and  who  commits  another  violation  within
      thirty-six months of the first violation.
        (3)  Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of
      a vehicle after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall,  no  sooner
      than  thirty days after such determination and upon a notice of at least
      five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at public sale. Any person, other
      than an owner whose interest is forfeited pursuant to this section,  who
      establishes  a  right  of  ownership  in  a  vehicle,  including  a part
      ownership or security interest, shall be  entitle  to  delivery  of  the
      vehicle if such person;
        (A)  redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by
      payment to the city of the value thereof;
        (B) pays the reasonable expenses of the  safekeeping  of  the  vehicle
      between the time of seizure and such redemption; and
        (C)  either  (i) asserts a claim in the forfeiture proceeding, or (ii)
      submits a claim in writing to the commission within  thirty  days  after
      judicial determination of forfeiture.
        (4)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph  three  of  this
      subdivision, establishment of a right of ownership shall not  entitle  a
      person  to  delivery  of  a  vehicle  if  the  city  establishes  in the
      forfeiture proceeding or in a separate administrative adjudication of  a
      claim  asserted  pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of this
      subdivision that the violations of subdivision b, c or k of this section
      upon which the forfeiture is  predicated  were  expressly  or  impliedly
      permitted  by  such  person.  The  commission  or successor agency shall
      promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the procedure for such an
      administrative  adjudication,  which  shall  include  provision  for   a
      hearing.
        (5)  For  purposes of this subdivision, the term "owner" shall mean an
      owner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and in  subdivision
      three  of  section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle and traffic
      law.
        (6) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the  seizure
      and  forfeiture  of  commuter  vans  which shall be governed by sections
      19-529.2 and 19-529.3 of this chapter.
        i. (1) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, any
      person  who  violates  any  provision  of  this  chapter  or  any   rule
      promulgated hereunder applicable to commuter van services, commuter vans
      or  drivers  of  commuter vans shall be subject to a civil penalty in an
      amount  to  be  prescribed  by  the  commission  by  rule  for  specific
      violations  which  amount  shall  not  exceed one thousand dollars for a
      first violation  and  twenty-five  hundred  dollars  for  a  second  and
      subsequent  violation  committed  within two years of a first violation.
      Where such violation involves the operation of a  commuter  van  service
      without  the  authorization required by this chapter, the operation of a
      commuter van without  the  license  required  by  this  chapter  or  the
      operation  of  a  commuter  van that is not pursuant to a current, valid
      authorization to operate a commuter van service, such  person  shall  be
      liable for a civil penalty of not less than five hundred dollars and not
      more than one thousand dollars, and for a subsequent violation committed
      within two years of the first violation, such person shall be liable for
      a  civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars and not more than
      twenty-five hundred dollars.
        (2) A proceeding to impose such civil penalty shall  be  commenced  by
      the service of a notice of violation returnable before the commission or
      an administrative tribunal of the commission. Such civil penalties shall
    
      be  imposed  after  a  hearing  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of the
      commission.
        (3)   Except   as   otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  four  of  this
      subdivision, civil penalties imposed by the commission or such  tribunal
      may  be  recovered  by  the corporation counsel in a civil action in any
      court of competent jurisdiction.
        (4) Decisions and orders of the commission or such  tribunal  imposing
      civil penalties for violations relating to the operation of commuter van
      service  without  authorization and the operation of unlicensed commuter
      vans and unlicensed drivers of commuter vans may be entered and enforced
      as if they were money judgments of a court pursuant to subdivision c  of
      section two thousand three hundred three of the charter.
        (5)  Notices  of  violation  which are returnable to the commission or
      such tribunal may be served by any officers or employees  designated  by
      the  commission,  any  police  officer  or  any  authorized  officers or
      employees of the department of  transportation  or  the  New  York  city
      transit authority.
        j.  Where  the  commission or administrative tribunal thereof finds an
      owner liable for operating a  vehicle  as  a  commuter  van  without  an
      authorization  to  operate  a commuter van service or without a commuter
      van license, the commission shall notify the New York state commissioner
      of motor vehicles pursuant  to  subparagraph  four  of  paragraph  a  of
      subdivision  five of section eighty of the New York state transportation
      law of such finding. Upon such notification, the commissioner  of  motor
      vehicles,  pursuant  to  such subparagraph four, shall thereupon suspend
      the registration of such vehicle and shall deny any application for  the
      registration  of such vehicle or any application for the renewal thereof
      pursuant to subdivision five-a  of  section  four  hundred  one  of  the
      vehicle  and  traffic  law  until  such  time as the commission may give
      notice that the  violation  has  been  corrected  to  its  satisfaction.
      Operation  of  any  motor  vehicle  for  which the registration has been
      suspended as herein provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. The
      commission shall also notify the department of finance where it finds an
      owner liable for operating a  vehicle  as  a  commuter  van  without  an
      authorization  to  operate  a commuter van service or without a commuter
      van license.
        k. No driver of any vehicle with a valid HAIL license shall  accept  a
      passenger  by  street  hail  within the city of New York from a location
      where street hails by such vehicles are not permitted.
        (i) A violation of this subdivision shall be punishable by a  fine  of
      five  hundred  dollars  for  the  first  violation.  A violation of this
      subdivision shall be punishable by a fine of seven hundred fifty dollars
      when a driver has been convicted of  a  violation  of  this  subdivision
      within the immediately preceding twenty-four months. A violation of this
      subdivision  shall  result  in revocation of the driver's license issued
      pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (iii) of subdivision a of section  19-505
      of  this  chapter  when  such violation is committed by a driver who has
      previously been convicted of two violations of this section  within  the
      immediately preceding one hundred twenty months.
        (ii)  A  finding  that  a  driver  has  committed  a violation of this
      subdivision shall be evidence that the owner  or  operator  holding  the
      HAIL  license  with  respect  to the vehicle in which such violation was
      committed failed to make a reasonable good faith  effort  to  deter  the
      commission  of  such  violation.  A  driver's  third  conviction of this
      subdivision within one hundred twenty months shall result in  revocation
      of  a  HAIL license if each such violation occurred in a vehicle subject
      to a HAIL license held by such owner or operator of one or more of  such
      HAIL  licenses.  The  New  York  city  taxi  and limousine commission or
    
      successor agency shall advise such owner or operator  holding  the  HAIL
      license  of his or her potential liability pursuant to this section upon
      a finding that a violation of paragraph  (i)  of  this  subdivision  was
      committed in a vehicle with a valid HAIL license.
        l.  A  person  is  guilty of unlawful fleeing a New York city taxi and
      limousine enforcement officer or police officer when, knowing that he or
      she has been directed to remain stopped by a  New  York  city  taxi  and
      limousine enforcement officer or police officer, the driver of a vehicle
      operating  pursuant  to a HAIL license who is stopped in a zone where he
      or she is not permitted to pick up street hails thereafter  attempts  to
      flee  such  officer  by setting the vehicle in motion and either travels
      over  three  hundred  feet  without  stopping  or  engages  in   conduct
      constituting  reckless  driving  as  defined  in  section twelve hundred
      twelve of the vehicle and traffic law. Unlawful fleeing a New York  city
      taxi   and   limousine  enforcement  officer  or  police  officer  is  a
      misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than  seven  hundred  fifty
      dollars  nor  more  than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment of not
      more  than  ninety  days  or  by  both  such  fine   and   imprisonment.
      Notwithstanding  any  contrary  provision  of law, any charge alleging a
      violation of this subdivision shall be returnable before a court  having
      jurisdiction over misdemeanors.
        m.  On or before February 1, 2013 and on a quarterly basis thereafter,
      the commission shall post on its website and provide to  the  council  a
      report  for the prior quarter that includes, at a minimum, the following
      information, subject to the manner that such data is available: (i)  the
      number  of  criminal  actions  commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph one of
      subdivision b of this section;  (ii)  the  number  of  criminal  actions
      commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph two of subdivision b of this section;
      (iii) the number of civil actions commenced pursuant to paragraph one of
      subdivision e  of  this  section;  (iv)  the  number  of  civil  actions
      commenced  pursuant  to  paragraph two of subdivision e of this section;
      and (v) the number of vehicles  seized  pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of
      subdivision h of this section, disaggregated by whether such vehicle was
      seized  for a violation of paragraph one or two of subdivision b of this
      section.  Such  report  shall  also  be  disaggregated  by  borough  and
      precinct.

Section 19-506.1 ::    
        
     
        §  19-506.1 Administrative Tribunal. a. If the commission is unable to
      produce a complaining witness in person, where such witness' credibility
      is relevant to  the  charges  made  in  the  notice  of  violation,  the
      commission  shall make reasonable efforts to make such witness available
      during the hearing by  videoconferencing  or  teleconferencing.  If  the
      complaining  witness  is  not available during a hearing, the commission
      shall produce a statement outlining its efforts to produce such witness.
      An administrative law judge shall examine such statement and  if  he  or
      she  decides the commission's efforts to produce the complaining witness
      were inadequate, the administrative law judge shall dismiss  the  notice
      of violation.
        b.  Hearings where the commission seeks the revocation of a commission
      issued license for a rule  violation  that  does  not  provide  for  the
      mandatory  revocation  of  such  license as a penalty shall be conducted
      before the office of administrative trials and  hearings  and  shall  be
      subject to the procedures of that tribunal. The commission may authorize
      other  hearings  to  be  conducted  before  the office of administrative
      trials and hearings.
        c.  If  a  respondent  timely  files  to  appeal  a  decision  of  the
      administrative   tribunal,  any  fines  imposed  by  the  administrative
      tribunal shall be stayed until  a  decision  is  made  in  such  appeal,
      provided  that  the commission shall not be required to refund any fines
      paid before respondent made his or her  appeal  unless  such  appeal  is
      successful.  The  administrative  tribunal  shall  expedite  any  appeal
      involving a suspension or revocation of a commission issued license.
        d. If, for the purposes of appealing a decision, a respondent requests
      a copy of the hearing recording, such recording  shall  be  produced  to
      such  respondent  within  thirty days after receipt of a written request
      from such respondent. If the commission  cannot  produce  the  recording
      within  the thirty day period, the determination being appealed shall be
      dismissed without prejudice.
        e. Notwithstanding any other  laws,  rules  or  regulations,  where  a
      respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, such respondent shall
      have  two  years  from  the entry of any determination to move to vacate
      such determination and seek a new hearing. After  mailing  a  notice  of
      default   to  a  respondent,  the  commission  shall  prepare  a  record
      containing the name of the person who mailed such notice, and the  date,
      time and method used to mail such notice. The commission shall make such
      record available upon request to such respondent.

Section 19-507 ::    
        
     
        §  19-507  Mandatory  penalties. a. The commission or successor agency
      shall fine any driver, or suspend or revoke the driver's license of  any
      driver,  as  provided  in  subdivision b of this section, who shall have
      been found in violation of any of the following:
        1. No driver of a taxicab shall seek to ascertain, without justifiable
      grounds, the destination of a passenger before such passenger  shall  be
      seated in the vehicle.
        2.  No  driver of a taxicab shall refuse, without justifiable grounds,
      to take any passenger or prospective passenger to any destination within
      the city.
        3. No driver of a vehicle the fares of which are set by the commission
      or successor agency shall charge or attempt to charge a fare  above  the
      fare set by the commission or successor agency.
        4.  No  driver  of a for-hire vehicle, other than a driver operating a
      for-hire vehicle with a valid  HAIL  license,  shall  accept  passengers
      unless  the  passengers  have engaged the use of the for-hire vehicle on
      the basis of telephone contract or prearrangement.
        b. 1. Any driver who has been found to have violated  a  provision  of
      paragraph  one,  two  or  three of subdivision a of this section, or any
      combination thereof, shall be fined not less than  two  hundred  dollars
      nor more than five hundred dollars for the first offense. Any driver who
      has been found in violation of any of the provisions of such paragraphs,
      or any combination thereof, for a second time within a twenty-four month
      period shall be fined not less than three hundred fifty dollars nor more
      than  one  thousand dollars, and the commission may suspend the driver's
      license of such driver for a period  not  to  exceed  thirty  days.  Any
      driver  who  has  been  found  to have violated any of the provisions of
      paragraph one, two or three of  such  subdivision,  or  any  combination
      thereof,  three  or more times within a thirty-six month period shall be
      fined not more  than  one  thousand  dollars  for  each  such  third  or
      subsequent offense, and the commission shall revoke the driver's license
      of  such  driver.  Any driver who has been found to have violated any of
      the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision a of this section  shall
      be  fined  not less than two hundred dollars nor more than three hundred
      fifty dollars for the first offense. Any driver who has  been  found  in
      violation  of  any of the provisions of such paragraph for a second time
      within a twenty-four month period shall be fined  not  less  than  three
      hundred  fifty  dollars  nor  more  than  five  hundred dollars, and the
      commission may suspend the driver's license of such driver for a  period
      not  to  exceed  thirty  days.  The commission shall revoke the driver's
      license of any driver who has been found to have  violated  any  of  the
      provisions  of  paragraph  four  of such subdivision three or more times
      within a thirty-six month period.
        2.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph   one   of   this
      subdivision,  the  commission  shall  revoke the driver's license of any
      person found to have violated paragraph three of subdivision a  of  this
      section  by  charging  or  attempting to charge a fare of ten dollars or
      more above the approved rate of fare for taxicabs.
        3. Any driver or vehicle owner of a vehicle licensed by the commission
      or base station licensee who facilitates sex trafficking with a  vehicle
      shall  be  liable  for  a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars, and the
      commission shall revoke the license of such driver, the license  of  the
      vehicle used to commit such facilitation when the person who facilitated
      sex  trafficking  is  the  owner of such vehicle, and the license of the
      base station licensee when such base  station  licensee  committed  such
      facilitation  and  the  vehicle  used  to  commit  such facilitation was
      affiliated with the base station licensed by such licensee at  the  time
      such offense was committed.
    
        c.  The  commission  shall not issue any license under this chapter to
      any person who has had his or her driver's license revoked  pursuant  to
      subdivision  b  of  this  section prior to a period of one year from the
      date of such revocation.
        d.  1.  Each  owner  shall  make  a reasonable good faith effort, by a
      driver education program or other affirmative  measures,  to  deter  the
      commission of violations of paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision
      a  of  this  section by drivers of taxicabs for which such owner holds a
      vehicle license. A finding that a driver has committed  a  violation  of
      any  such paragraph shall create a rebuttable presumption that the owner
      holding the vehicle license for the taxicab in which such violation  was
      committed has failed to make a reasonable good faith effort to deter the
      commission  of such violation. In any proceeding for a violation of this
      paragraph, it is an affirmative defense that the owner made a reasonable
      good faith effort, by a driver education program  or  other  affirmative
      measures,  to  deter the commission of violations of paragraphs one, two
      and three of subdivision a of this section. The commission shall  advise
      an  owner  in writing of his or her potential liability pursuant to this
      subdivision upon a finding  that  a  violation  of  such  paragraph  was
      committed in a taxicab for which such owner holds a vehicle license.
        2. If the owner holding a vehicle license for a taxicab or taxicabs in
      which  a  driver or drivers have been found to have committed violations
      of paragraphs one, two or three of subdivision a of this section, or any
      combination thereof, is found not to have made a reasonable  good  faith
      effort  to  deter  such  violation,  the  owner  shall  be  liable for a
      violation of paragraph one of this subdivision as follows:
        (i) for the second violation  of  paragraphs  one,  two  or  three  of
      subdivision  a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed in
      a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds  a  vehicle  license  or
      licenses, the commission shall fine the owner two hundred dollars;
        (ii)  for  the  third  violation  of  paragraphs  one, two or three of
      subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed  in
      a  taxicab  or  taxicabs  for which the owner holds a vehicle license or
      licenses, the commission shall fine the owner not less that two  hundred
      dollars nor more than three hundred fifty dollars;
        (iii)  for the fourth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one,
      two or three of subdivision  a  of  this  section,  or  any  combination
      thereof,  committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a
      vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall  fine  the  owner  not
      less than three hundred fifty nor more than five hundred dollars;
        (iv)  for  the  fifth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one,
      two or three of subdivision  a  of  this  section,  or  any  combination
      thereof,  committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a
      vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall  suspend  the  vehicle
      license  of  the  taxicab  used  in  the  commission  of the most recent
      violation for a period not to exceed sixty days.
        For purposes  of  this  paragraph,  the  obligation  to  have  made  a
      "reasonable  good  faith  effort"  shall  be  met if the owner, upon the
      hiring of each new driver and for all  drivers,  shall,  at  least  once
      annually,  distribute  a  copy  of  applicable  commission rules to each
      driver and obtains a written receipt  therefore.  The  commission  shall
      supply  owners  with  a  copy of all such applicable rules. In addition,
      such rules shall be conspicuously posted by the  owner  at  the  owner's
      place of business so that they are readily visible to all drivers.
        3. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth
      the  procedure  for  an  administrative  adjudication  of  violations of
      paragraph one of this subdivision, which  shall  include  provision  for
      notice and a hearing.
    
        e.  The  term  "without justifiable ground" used in paragraphs one and
      two of subdivision a  of  this  section  shall  mean  that  standard  of
      behavior  which  fails  to  conform  to that of a reasonable and prudent
      person acting in compliance with  any  regulations  promulgated  by  the
      commission.
        f. The commission may suspend or revoke the license of any person whom
      it  determines  has obtained a license by fraud or false representation,
      or willful misstatement or omission of a material fact.

Section 19-507.1 ::    
        
     
        §  19-507.1  Persistent  Violators  of  Rules  Relating  to Drivers of
      Taxicabs and For-Hire Vehicles. a. (1) On or after  September  1,  1999,
      any  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  driver  may  attend  a  remedial or
      refresher  course  approved  by  the   commission.   Upon   satisfactory
      completion  of  a  commission-approved course by such driver, two points
      shall  be  deducted  from  the  number  of  points  assessed  under  the
      persistent  violators  program  against  his  or her taxicab or for-hire
      vehicle driver's license.  A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be
      eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this  subdivision  only  once
      within the five-year period commencing on or after September 1, 1999.
        (2)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision, any taxicab or  for-hire  vehicle  driver  may  attend  one
      remedial  or  refresher  course  approved  by the commission between the
      effective date of this local law and August 31, 1999. Upon  satisfactory
      completion  of  a  commission-approved  course by such driver two points
      shall  be  deducted  from  the  number  of  points  assessed  under  the
      persistent  violators  program  against  his  or her taxicab or for-hire
      vehicle driver's license.
        (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one or  two  of  this
      subdivision,   no   point  reduction  shall  affect  any  suspension  or
      revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to  this
      program prior to the completion of the course and no taxicab or for-hire
      vehicle  driver shall receive a point reduction unless attendance at the
      course is voluntary on the part of the driver. If the commission has  no
      approved  remedial  or  refresher  course  on the effective date of this
      subdivision, then a department of motor vehicles-approved  course  shall
      be  deemed  acceptable  until  such  time  as  the commission approves a
      course.
        b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of
      violations of the commission's rules such that six or more  points  have
      been  assessed  against  his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver's
      license within any fifteen-month period and whose license has  not  been
      revoked  shall  have  his  or  her  taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver's
      license suspended for thirty days. The provisions  of  this  subdivision
      shall apply only to violations issued on or after July 26, 1998.
        c. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of
      violations  of  the commission's rules such that ten or more points have
      been assessed against his or her taxicab or  for-hire  vehicle  driver's
      license within any fifteen-month period shall have his or her taxicab or
      for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license  revoked.  The  provisions  of this
      subdivision shall apply only to violations issued on or after  July  26,
      1998.
        d.  For  the  purposes  of  assessing  points against the license of a
      taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver, where a taxicab or for-hire  vehicle
      driver  has  been  found  guilty  of  multiple violations arising from a
      single enforcement action  by  an  authorized  enforcement  agent,  such
      driver shall be deemed guilty of the single violation having the highest
      point assessment.
        e.  A  taxicab  or  for-hire vehicle driver shall not be subject to an
      assessment of points against his or  her  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle
      driver's license or the imposition of duplicate penalties where the same
      act  is  a violation under provisions of law other than commission rules
      and where such violations duplicate each other or are substantively  the
      same  and  any  such  driver may be issued only one summons or notice of
      violation for such violation. Points assessed by the department of motor
      vehicles by reason of violations under the vehicle and traffic  law  may
      not be added to points assessed by the commission under this section for
      violations of commission rules.
    
        f.  It  shall  be an affirmative defense that the act which formed the
      basis for the violation was beyond the  control  and  influence  of  the
      taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver.
        g.   Any   violation   issued   to  a  taxicab  driver  or  owner  for
      meter-tampering shall be served on the licensee by personal delivery  or
      by certified and regular mail within five calendar days of its issuance.
      The  licensee  shall have an opportunity to request a hearing before the
      commission or other administrative tribunal  of  competent  jurisdiction
      within  ten  calendar  days after receipt of any such notification. Upon
      request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days. If the
      tenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday,  the  hearing  may  be
      held  on the next business day. A decision shall be made with respect to
      any such proceeding within sixty calendar days after the  close  of  the
      hearing. In the event such decision is not made within that time period,
      the license or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be
      returned  by  the  commission  to  the licensee and deemed to be in full
      force and effect until such  determination  is  made.  It  shall  be  an
      affirmative  defense  to  any  violation for meter-tampering issued to a
      taxicab driver or owner  that  such  person  (i)  did  not  know  of  or
      participate  in  the  alleged  meter-tampering  and  (ii)  exercised due
      diligence to ensure that meter-tampering does not occur.
        h. For purposes of subdivision g  of  this  section,  examples  of  an
      owner's  due  diligence shall include, but are not limited to (1) giving
      to their drivers a clear warning that violations of the meter  tampering
      rules  will  result in the immediate termination of any lease agreement,
      the reporting to the commission of driver tampering and the commission's
      probable revocation  of  the  driver's  taxicab  driver's  license,  (2)
      including  in  any  written  lease  agreement  provisions containing the
      warnings against  violation  of  meter  tampering  rules,  (3)  stamping
      warnings  about  the  illegality  of  meter  tampering on the trip cards
      issued to all drivers of an  owner's  taxicabs,  (4)  having  management
      personnel  or mechanics periodically check for proper odometer and meter
      mileage comparisons in order to determine  if  there  are  inappropriate
      disparities  between  the  two  sets of figures, (5) conducting periodic
      random inspections of the taxicab meter and its wiring for  all  of  its
      taxicabs  to  detect  any  evidence  of violation of the meter tampering
      rules and (6) having  all  of  such  owner's  taxicabs  inspected  by  a
      licensed meter shop once every commission inspection cycle.

Section 19-507.2 ::    
        
     
        § 19-507.2 Critical driver program. a. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle
      driver  who  has  been  found guilty of violations such that six or more
      points have been assessed by the department  of  motor  vehicles  or  an
      equivalent  licensing  agency of the driver's state of residence against
      the driver license issued to such taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  driver
      within  any  fifteen-month  period and whose taxicab or for-hire vehicle
      driver's license has not been revoked shall have his or her  taxicab  or
      for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license  suspended  for  thirty  days.  The
      provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued  on
      or after February 15, 1999.
        b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of
      violations  such  that  ten  or  more  points  have been assessed by the
      department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing  agency  of  the
      driver's  state  of  residence against the driver license issued to such
      taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver within any fifteen-month period shall
      have his or her taxicab or for-hire vehicle  driver's  license  revoked.
      The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to violations issued
      on or after February 15, 1999.
        c.  (1)  On  or after September 1, 1999, a taxicab or for-hire vehicle
      driver shall be eligible to receive a two point reduction in the  number
      of  points  assessed  pursuant  to  the critical driver program upon the
      submission to the commission of proof of the satisfactory completion  of
      a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the department of
      motor  vehicles.  Such  point reduction shall be considered in computing
      the total number of points accumulated by such driver  as  a  result  of
      violations which occurred within fifteen months prior to the date of the
      completion of the course.
        (2)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision no point reduction shall affect any suspension or revocation
      action which may be taken by the commission  pursuant  to  this  program
      prior  to  the completion of the course. No person shall receive a point
      reduction more than once in any eighteen  month  period  and  no  person
      shall  receive  a  point  reduction  unless  attendance at the course is
      voluntary on the part of the driver.
        (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and two  of  this
      subdivision,  any  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle driver who voluntarily
      attends  and  satisfactorily  completes  one  motor   vehicle   accident
      prevention  course  approved by the department of motor vehicles between
      the effective date of this local law and August 31, 1999, shall have two
      points deducted from the total number of points assessed pursuant to the
      critical driver program against his or her taxicab or  for-hire  vehicle
      driver's  license.  No  point  reduction  shall affect any suspension or
      revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to  this
      program prior to the completion of the course.

      with the commission a current telephone number serviced by an  answering
      machine or recording device, a pager number, telephone answering service
      number or other information by which telephone contact with the owner or

--------------

Section 19-508 ::    
        
     
        § 19-508 Meters, radios and other equipment.  a. All taxicabs shall be
      equipped  with  meters,  and the equipment which shall store or transmit
      for storage fare data, including, but not limited to, the rate  of  fare
      and  the  times  or locations such rate of fares were in effect, pick up
      and  drop-off  information  and  any  other  data  as  required  by  the
      commission.  All  data  required  to  be  stored  or transmitted by such
      equipment shall be made available to the commission in a form and manner
      as required by the commission. A  licensed  driver's  fare  information,
      including rate of fare and pickup and drop-off information shall be made
      available  to such driver as required by the commission, at no charge to
      such drivers. The  commission  shall  prescribe  by  rule,  contract  or
      otherwise,  responsibility  for  compliance  with the provisions of this
      section, and for penalties for non-compliance with such provisions.  The
      commission  may permit or require other licensed vehicles to be equipped
      with the same or different types of meters.
        b. The commission may permit or require the installation of  radio  or
      other equipment of specified types in licensed vehicles, except that the
      commission  shall  require  that  all wheelchair accessible vans contain
      two-way radios where  the  owner  employs  a  dispatcher,  a  number  of
      portable  or  fixed seat belts equal to the maximum capacity of the van,
      safety ties sufficient to secure any wheelchair or wheelchairs which the
      van may at any  given  time  be  transporting  and  such  other  special
      equipment  as  the commission shall determine is necessary to insure the
      safe transportation of physically handicapped  persons.  The  commission
      shall  require  the  use  of a specified frequency for any radio used by
      licensed  vehicles,  said  frequency  to  be  assigned  by  the  federal
      communications commission.
        c.  1.  For  purposes  of this section, the term "trouble light" shall
      mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting  of  two  turn
      signal type "lollipop" lights.
        2. Every for-hire vehicle or taxicab placed into operation shall carry
      a  minimum  of  two  spare  turn signal type "lollipop" lights of a type
      approved by the commission. In the event that any authorized enforcement
      agent indicates to  a  for-hire  vehicle  or  taxicab  driver  that  the
      vehicle's  trouble  light  is  defective,  such  driver  shall  have the
      opportunity to return such defective trouble  light  to  proper  working
      order by replacing one or both bulbs, or by any other corrective action,
      in  the presence of such enforcement agent. If the replacement of a bulb
      or bulbs, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light  to
      proper  working  order,  no summons or notice of violation may be issued
      for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab  with  a  defective  trouble
      light.  In  the event that repair of the defective condition is not made
      in the presence of such enforcement agent and a  summons  or  notice  of
      violation  is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble
      light, such summons or notice of violation shall  be  dismissed  by  the
      adjudicatory  body  before  which such summons or notice of violation is
      heard if:  (a)  proof  that  repair  of  such  defect  was  made  within
      twenty-four  hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation
      is provided to the adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle  was  not  used
      for  hire  during  the period of time from when the summons or notice of
      violation was issued to the time the repair was made.
        3.  Any  person  found  to  have  violated  the  provisions  of   this
      subdivision  shall  be  liable  for  a  fine of one hundred seventy-five
      dollars for each such violation and in addition thereto the license  for
      such  vehicle  shall  be  suspended  until  the  defective  condition is
      corrected.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 19-509
--------------

Section 19-509 ::    
        
     
        §  19-509 Licensing of taximeter business. a. It shall be unlawful for
      any  person  to  engage  in  the  business  of  manufacturing,  selling,
      repairing and adjusting or calibrating taximeters or taximeter equipment
      for  use  upon  any  licensed vehicle in the city unless he or she shall
      secure a license therefor from the commission, and such  person  engaged
      in  the  business  of  installing,  repairing,  adjusting or calibrating
      taximeters shall only be licensed if he shall have a place  of  business
      within  the  city  large  enough  simultaneously to accommodate at least
      three vehicles. Such licenses shall be issued for a period not exceeding
      one year and shall expire on the thirty-first day of March following the
      date of issue. The fee for the issuance of each such  license  shall  be
      five  hundred  dollars  per  annum  for  each place of business licensed
      provided, however, that upon the issuance of a license for a  period  of
      six  months  or  less, the fee shall be one-half the annual fee fixed by
      the commission.
        b. It shall be unlawful for  such  person  to  sell  or  attach  to  a
      licensed  vehicle  for  use  within  the city a taximeter which does not
      comply with the rules and regulations established by the commission, and
      the commission may establish such rules and regulations  in  respect  to
      the   taximeter  business  as  may  be  reasonable  to  assure  adequate
      protection of the public and enforcement of the provisions and  purposes
      of this chapter and may require such reports and other information as it
      deems  necessary  or  advisable.  Any  person who shall install, repair,
      adjust or calibrate any taximeter shall securely affix to the inside  of
      the  glass window thereon, so as to be clearly legible from the outside,
      a printed poster bearing his or her license number.
        c. Fees to be charged by persons licensed  pursuant  to  this  section
      shall  be  subject to approval of the commission. In determining whether
      any proposed fee or fee schedules  shall  be  approved,  the  commission
      shall  take  into consideration the nature of the service performed, the
      costs of the licensee, a reasonable profit to  the  licensee,  fees  for
      similar  services  charged  in other communities, and the welfare of the
      taxicab and taximeter industries.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 19-511
--------------

Section 19-511 ::    
        
     
        § 19-511 Licensing of communications systems and base stations. a. The
      commission  shall require licenses for the operation of two-way radio or
      other  communications  systems  used  for   dispatching   or   conveying
      information to drivers of licensed vehicles, including for-hire vehicles
      or  wheelchair  accessible  vans  and  shall  require  licenses for base
      stations, upon such terms as it deems  advisable  and  upon  payment  of
      reasonable  license  fees  of not more than five hundred dollars a year.
      There shall be an additional fee of twenty-five dollars for late  filing
      of  a  license renewal application where such filing is permitted by the
      commission.
        b. The operator of a base station shall  provide  and  utilize  lawful
      off-street  facilities  for  the  parking  and  storage  of the licensed
      for-hire vehicles that are to be dispatched from that base station equal
      to not less than one parking  space  for  every  two  such  vehicles  or
      fraction  thereof.  The  commission shall establish by rule criteria for
      off-street parking which shall include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the
      maximum   permissible   distance  between  the  base  station  and  such
      off-street parking facilities  and  the  proximity  of  such  off-street
      parking   facilities  and  the  proximity  of  such  off-street  parking
      facilities to residences and community  facilities  as  defined  in  the
      zoning  resolution  of  the  city  of New York. A license for a new base
      station shall only be granted where the applicant  has  demonstrated  to
      the  commission  prior  to  the issuance of such license that off-street
      parking facilities  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  this
      subdivision shall be provided.
        c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b of this section, a
      license for a base station which was valid on the effective date of this
      section shall only be renewed upon the condition that within  two  years
      of such renewal the licensee shall provide off-street parking facilities
      as required by subdivision b of this section.
        d.  (1)  No  license for a new base station shall be issued unless the
      applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the  commission  that  the
      applicant  will  comply  with  the  off-street  parking  requirements of
      subdivision b  of  this  section  and  the  commission  finds  that  the
      operation  of  a  base station by the applicant at the proposed location
      would meet such other criteria as may be established by the  commission.
      Among  the  other  factors  which must be examined and considered by the
      commission in making a determination to issue a license are the adequacy
      of existing mass transit and mass transportation facilities to meet  the
      transportation  needs of the public any adverse impact that the proposed
      operation may have on those existing services and  the  fitness  of  the
      applicant.  In  determining  the fitness of the applicant the commission
      shall consider, but is not limited to considering, such factors  as  the
      ability  of  the  applicant  to  adequately manage the base station, the
      applicant's financial stability and whether the  applicant  operates  or
      previously  operated a licensed base station and the manner in which any
      such base station was operated. The commission shall also  consider  the
      extent  and  quality  of service provided by existing lawfully operating
      for-hire vehicles and taxicabs.
        (2) No license for a new base station shall be issued for a period  of
      three   years   subsequent   to   a   determination  in  a  judicial  or
      administrative  proceeding  that   the   applicant   or   any   officer,
      shareholder,  director  or  partner  of  the  applicant  operated a base
      station that had not been licensed by the commission.
        (3) In its review of an application for a license  to  operate  a  new
      base station and in its review of an application to renew a base station
      license  the  commission shall also consider the possible adverse effect
      of such base station on the quality of life in the vicinity of the  base
    
      station  including,  but  not  limited  to, traffic congestion, sidewalk
      congestion and noise. In its review of an application to  renew  a  base
      station   license   the   commission   shall  also  consider  whether  a
      determination  has been made after an administrative proceeding that the
      operator has violated any applicable rule of the commission.
        (4) No base station  license  shall  be  renewed  where  it  has  been
      determined  after  an  administrative  proceeding that the applicant has
      failed to comply with the off-street parking requirements set  forth  in
      subdivision b of this section or as they may have been modified pursuant
      to subdivision h of this section.
        e.  A  licensed base station shall at all times have no fewer than ten
      affiliated vehicles, except that a base station for which a license  was
      first  issued  prior to January 1, 1988 and which at that time had fewer
      than ten affiliated vehicles or a base station which has an  affiliation
      with  a wheelchair accessible vehicle may have as few as five affiliated
      vehicles, not including black cars and luxury limousines.
        f. Prior to the issuance of a  license  for  a  base  station  or  the
      renewal  of a valid base station license, the applicant shall provide to
      the commission a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars with one or
      more sureties to be approved by the commission. Such bond shall  be  for
      the  benefit  of  the  city  and  shall be conditioned upon the licensee
      complying with the requirement that the licensee dispatch only  vehicles
      which  are currently licensed by the commission and which have a current
      New York city commercial use  motor  vehicle  tax  stamp  and  upon  the
      payment  by  the licensee of all civil penalties imposed pursuant to any
      provision of this chapter.
        g. Upon receiving an application for the issuance of a license  for  a
      new  base  station  or  for  the renewal of a license for a base station
      pursuant to this section, the commission  shall,  within  five  business
      days,  submit  a  copy  of  such  application  to the council and to the
      district office of the council member and the community  board  for  the
      area in which the base station is or would be located.
        h.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivisions b and c of this
      section, the commission may reduce the  number  of  required  off-street
      parking  spaces  or may waive such requirement in its entirety where the
      commission  determines  that  sufficient   lawful   off-street   parking
      facilities do not exist within the maximum permissible distance from the
      base  station  or  an  applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
      commission that complying with the off-street parking  requirements  set
      forth  in  such  subdivisions would impose an economic hardship upon the
      applicant; except that the commission shall  not  reduce  or  waive  the
      off-street  parking  requirements  where  it  has  been determined in an
      administrative proceeding  that  the  applicant,  or  a  predecessor  in
      interest, has violated any provision of section 6-03 of the rules of the
      commission  or  any  successor thereto, as such may from time to time be
      amended. A determination to  waive  or  reduce  the  off-street  parking
      requirements  shall  be  made  in  writing,  shall  contain  a  detailed
      statement of the reasons why such determination was made  and  shall  be
      made  a part of the commission's determination to approve an application
      for a base station license.
        i. The determination by the commission to approve an application for a
      license to operate a new base station or for the renewal of a license to
      operate a base station shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied
      by copies of the data, information and other materials  relied  upon  by
      the commission in making that determination. Such determination shall be
      sent  to  the  council  and to the district office of the council member
      within whose district that base station is or would  be  located  within
      five business days of such determination being made.

Section 19-511.1 ::    
        
     
        §  19-511.1  Council  review.  Any  determination by the commission to
      approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or to
      renew a license to operate a base station shall be subject to review  by
      the  council.  Within  ninety days of the first stated meeting following
      receipt of  such  determination  and  its  accompanying  materials,  the
      council may approve or disapprove such determination by local law, after
      having  adopted  a resolution to review that determination. In the event
      that the council fails to act by local law within the ninety day  period
      provided  for in this section, the determination of the commission shall
      remain in effect. Where a base station license  would  otherwise  expire
      while  a  determination  by  the commission to approve a renewal of such
      license is pending before the council, such license shall remain in full
      force and effect, unless suspended or revoked by the  commission,  until
      either   the   council  has  passed  a  local  law  to  disapprove  such
      determination or the  period  within  which  the  council  may  act  has
      elapsed.

Section 19-512 ::    
        
     
        §  19-512  Transferability  of  taxicab  licenses  issued prior to the
      effective date of this chapter. a.  Any  taxicab  license  first  issued
      prior  to  July sixteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, and in force on
      such date,  and  any  renewals  thereof,  shall  be  transferable  to  a
      transferee  who  has  demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commission
      that he is qualified to assume the duties and obligations of  a  taxicab
      owner,  provided  that  either  the  applicant  or  his or her vendor or
      transferor shall have filed a bond to cover  all  the  outstanding  tort
      liabilities  of the vendor or transferor in excess of the amount covered
      by a bond or insurance policy which is in effect pursuant to the vehicle
      and traffic law of the state of New York.
        b. No voluntary sale or transfer of such taxicab license may  be  made
      if  a  judgment  has  been filed within the city against the holder of a
      license and remains unsatisfied and notice of  said  judgment  has  been
      filed with the commission, except that a transfer may be permitted if an
      appeal  is  pending  from an unsatisfied judgment and a bond is filed in
      sufficient amount to satisfy  the  judgment.  A  transfer  may  also  be
      permitted  without  filing  a  bond  as  set  forth  in this subdivision
      provided that all the judgment creditors of unsatisfied  judgments  file
      written  permission  for such a transfer with the commission or provided
      that the proceeds of sale are paid into court or held in escrow on terms
      and conditions approved by the commission which will have the effect  of
      protecting the rights of all parties who may have an interest therein.
        c.  An  owner's  interest  in  such taxicab license may be transferred
      involuntarily and disposed of by public or  private  sale  in  the  same
      manner   as   personal   property  provided,  however,  that  upon  such
      involuntary transfer the owner's license shall immediately be  cancelled
      and a new license issued to the purchaser or his or her vendee, provided
      that  such purchaser or vendee satisfied the requirements of subdivision
      (a) hereof, except that if the judgment against the involuntary transfer
      is by reason of a tort judgment against the involuntary  transferor,  no
      bond need be provided with respect to the same judgment.
        d.  The  commission  may charge a fee of one hundred sixty dollars for
      its administrative expenses in connection with the transfer  (i)  of  an
      owner's  interest  in  a  taxicab  license  transferable pursuant to the
      provisions of this section or (ii) of the stock in a  corporation  which
      is  an  owner  of a taxicab license that is transferable pursuant to the
      provisions of this section.

Section 19-512.1 ::    
        
     
        §  19-512.1  Revocation  of  taxicab,  for-hire  or  HAIL  license  or
      licenses.  a. The commission or successor agency  may,  for  good  cause
      shown  relating  to a direct and substantial threat to the public health
      or safety and prior to giving notice and an opportunity for  a  hearing,
      suspend  a  taxicab,  for-hire  vehicle license or a HAIL license issued
      pursuant to this chapter and, after notice  and  an  opportunity  for  a
      hearing,  suspend  or  revoke  such license. The commission or successor
      agency may also, without having suspended a  taxicab,  for-hire  vehicle
      license  or  a HAIL license, issue a determination to seek suspension or
      revocation of such license and after notice and  an  opportunity  for  a
      hearing, suspend or revoke such license. Notice of such suspension or of
      a determination by the commission or successor agency to seek suspension
      or  revocation  of a taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license
      shall be served on the licensee by personal delivery or by certified and
      regular mail within five calendar days of the pre-hearing suspension  or
      of such determination. The licensee shall have an opportunity to request
      a  hearing  before  an administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction
      within ten calendar days after receipt of any  such  notification.  Upon
      request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days, unless
      the  commission  or successor agency or other administrative tribunal of
      competent jurisdiction determines that such hearing would be prejudicial
      to an ongoing criminal or civil investigation. If the tenth day falls on
      a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the hearing  may  be  held  on  the  next
      business  day.  A  decision  shall  be  made  with  respect  to any such
      proceeding within sixty calendar days after the close of the hearing. In
      the event such decision is not made within that time period, the license
      or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be returned by
      the commission or successor agency to the licensee and deemed to  be  in
      full  force  and  effect  until  such  determination is made, unless the
      commission or successor  agency  or  other  administrative  tribunal  of
      competent   jurisdiction   determines   that   the   issuance   of  such
      determination would be prejudicial  to  an  ongoing  criminal  or  civil
      investigation.
        b.  It shall be an affirmative defense that the holder of the taxicab,
      for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license or the owner of the  taxicab,
      for-hire  vehicle or HAIL vehicle has (1) exercised due diligence in the
      inspection, management and/or operation of the taxicab, for-hire vehicle
      or HAIL vehicle and (2) did not know or have reason to know of the  acts
      of  any  other  person  with  respect  to that taxicab license, for-hire
      vehicle license or a HAIL license or taxicab, for-hire vehicle  or  HAIL
      vehicle  upon  which  a  suspension,  proposed  suspension  or  proposed
      revocation  is  based.  With  respect  to  any  violation  arising  from
      taximeter  tampering, an owner's due diligence shall include, but not be
      limited to, those actions set forth in subdivision h of section 19-507.1
      of this chapter. Any pre-hearing  suspension  period  shall  be  counted
      towards any suspension period made in any final determination.

Section 19-513 ::    
        
     
        § 19-513 Repossessions. Any taxicab which is transferred involuntarily
      because  of  a  default  in  the  payment  or installments due under the
      contract of sale, or any other contract or in any other  manner  whereby
      the  license  holder's  interest in the license is not also transferred,
      and which is disposed according to law at public or private sale, may be
      operated by the purchaser thereof or his or her  vendee,  provided  such
      purchaser or vendee is acceptable to the commission as a person suitable
      to  receive  a  license.  Upon such involuntary transfer, the license of
      said  taxicab  shall  be  cancelled   immediately   and   a   temporary,
      nontransferable, nonrenewable license issued to such purchaser or vendee
      for  a  period  not  exceeding one year upon the payment of a fee of not
      exceeding one hundred dollars therefor. At the end  of  such  time,  the
      original  holder of the license, or his or her transferee if the license
      was first issued before the effective date of  this  chapter,  shall  be
      entitled  to  renewal  of  the  license, provided that the provisions of
      subdivision (a) of section 19-512 of this chapter are complied  with  by
      such  applicant,  whether  he  or  she  is  the  original  holder  or  a
      transferee.

      shall be painted yellow or any shade thereof.
        b. The name of the corporate owner shall be printed on both rear doors
      or on both front doors of each taxicab in such  a  manner  as  shall  be
      prescribed by the commission.
        c.  The  commission  may  grant to any taxicab owner or association of
      taxicab owners, upon proper application therefor, the exclusive right to
      use one or more distinctive emblems or other identifying designs  to  be
      displayed on the vehicles of such applicant.
        d.  Such  applications  must  include colored sketches of the proposed
      color schemes of the emblems or designs, together with  such  other  and
      further information as the commission may require.
        e.  An  owner  shall  not  use  an  emblem granted to another owner or
      association, an emblem so similar as to lead to confusion in the mind of
      the public, or an emblem granted to any association unless he or she  be
      a  member of said association. The commission may suspend the license of
      any owner violating the provisions hereof.
        f. Each taxicab license shall be  represented  by  a  metal  medallion
      which shall bear the license number and be affixed to the outside of the
      licensed  taxicab. The commission may require that a notice be posted at
      the main entrance of each garage housing taxicab vehicles  reciting  the
      number   of   such  vehicles,  their  license  numbers  and  such  other
      information as the commission may designate.
        g. Any vehicle for hire except those licensed under the provisions  of
      this  chapter  shall not bear the colors yellow, orange, or gold, or, in
      combination  of  yellow-white,  orange-white,  gold-white,  green-white,
      blue-white  or  any  other combination of the above said colors or color
      scheme or striping in said colors.
        h.  Any  accessible  taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  licensed  by  the
      commission  shall display the international wheelchair insignia or other
      insignia approved by the commission that identifies such vehicle  as  an
      accessible  vehicle,  in  a  minimum  of two prominent locations on such
      vehicle's  exterior.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "accessible
      vehicle"  shall mean any vehicle approved for use by the commission as a
      taxicab  or  for-hire  vehicle  that  meets   the   specifications   and
      requirements  for  accessible  vehicles  pursuant  to the americans with
      disabilities act of 1990, as  amended,  and  rules  promulgated  by  the
      commission.
        i.  Any clean air vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the
      words "CLEAN AIR VEHICLE" or such other term or symbol approved  by  the
      commission  that  identifies  such  vehicle  as a clean air vehicle in a
      minimum of two prominent locations on such vehicle's exterior.  For  the
      purposes of this subdivision, "clean air vehicle" shall mean any taxicab
      or  for-hire vehicle approved for use by the commission that receives an
      air  pollution  score  of  9.0  or  higher  from   the   United   States
      environmental protection agency or its successor agency and is estimated
      to  emit  6.4  tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the
      United States department of energy or  its  successor  agency;  provided
      that  such  vehicle  is powered by the fuel for which such vehicle meets
      the above-specified standards. In the event the test method used by  the
      United  States  environmental  protection agency or its successor agency
      for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way  that  impacts  United
      States  department  of  energy  or  its  successor  agency  estimates of
      equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles,  the  commission
      shall, for vehicles that fall within the affected model years, modify by
      rule the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions estimate included herein so
      as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact consistent with the
      intent of this section.

      displayed on the outside or inside of the vehicle in such form as  shall
      be  prescribed  by  the  commission,  except  that  the  commission  may
      prescribe an exemption from this requirement  for  classes  of  for-hire
      vehicles  for  which  such  display would be inappropriate. All for-hire
      vehicles must at all times carry in the glove  compartment  and  produce
      upon  demand of any police, peace, law enforcement officer, inspector or
      officer of the commission:
        1. The for-hire vehicle license.
        2. The driver's for-hire vehicle-driver's license.

        §  19-516  Acceptance  of passengers by for-hire vehicles and commuter
      vans. a. For-hire vehicles that do not possess a valid HAIL license  may
      accept   passengers   only   on  the  basis  of  telephone  contract  or
      prearrangement. The commission or successor agency  may  establish  such
      disciplinary actions as it deems appropriate for failure to abide by the
      provisions of this chapter.
        b.  No commuter van service and no person who owns, operates or drives
      a commuter van, shall provide, permit  or  authorize  the  provision  of
      transportation service to a passenger unless such service to a passenger
      is on the basis of a telephone contract or other prearrangement and such
      prearrangement  is  evidenced  by  such  records  as are required by the
      commission to be maintained. Where a violation of this  subdivision  has
      been  committed  by a driver of a commuter van, the commuter van service
      and the owner of such vehicle shall also be liable for  a  violation  of
      this subdivision.

      transferred  or  assigned,  nor  shall  such  vehicle license be used in
      affiliation with any garage or business location other than the location
      stated in such license.
        b. Any base station license or ownership interest in the licensee  may
      be  transferred  to  a  proposed  transferee who has demonstrated to the
      satisfaction of the commission the qualifications to assume  the  duties
      and  obligations  of  a  base  station  owner  provided  that either the
      transferor or transferee shall have  filed  a  bond  to  cover  all  the
      outstanding  tort  liabilities  of  the  transferor  arising  out of the
      operation of a base station and  the  for-hire  vehicles  owned  by  the
      transferor  which  is  in  excess  of  the amount covered by any bond or
      insurance policy in effect pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law,  and
      all  outstanding  fines,  penalties  and  other  liabilities  which  the
      transferor owes to the commission shall have been  satisfied.  All  such
      transfers  and  any  changes  in  corporate offices or directors must be
      approved by the commission in order  to  be  effective.  The  commission
      shall  establish  by rule the factors to be considered for approval of a
      proposed transferee, officer or director which shall include, but not be
      limited to, the criminal history of the proposed transferee and  of  the
      transferee's  officers, shareholders, directors and partners, if any, or
      the proposed officers or directors, in a manner consistent with  article
      twenty-three-A   of   the   correction  law,  any  relevant  information
      maintained in the records of the department of  motor  vehicles  or  the
      commission, and transferee's financial stability.
        c.  A  transfer  shall  not  be approved if in the past two years, the
      proposed transferee or any officer, shareholder, director or partner  of
      the  proposed  transferee,  where  appropriate,  has  been found to have
      violated any law or rule involving:
        (i) assaultive behavior toward a passenger, official or member of  the
      public in connection with any matter relating to a for-hire vehicle;
        (ii)  conviction  for  giving  or  offering  an unlawful gratuity to a
      public servant, as defined in section 10.00 of the penal law;
        (iii) providing the commission with false information; or
        (iv)  three  unexplained  failures   to   respond   to   an   official
      communication of the commission or the department of investigation which
      was sent via certified mail, return receipt requested.
        d.  No  voluntary  transfer of a base station license may be made if a
      judgment in favor of the city of New York or any agency thereof  or  any
      state  or  federal agency has been docketed with the clerk of any county
      within  the  city  of  New  York  against  the  licensee   and   remains
      unsatisfied,  except  that  a  transfer may be permitted if an appeal is
      pending from an unsatisfied judgment and a bond is filed  in  an  amount
      sufficient  to  satisfy  the  judgment. A transfer may also be permitted
      without filing a bond as set forth in this subdivision provided that all
      the judgment creditors of a licensee file written permission for such  a
      transfer  with the commission or that the proceeds from the transfer are
      paid into court or held in escrow on terms and  conditions  approved  by
      the  commission  which  will have the effect of protecting the rights of
      all parties who may have an interest therein.
        e. The commission may by rule establish a fee in  connection  with  an
      application  to transfer a base station license or an ownership interest
      in a base station licensee.
        f. The commission shall revoke any base station license for nonuse  in
      the event it shall find after a public hearing that the base station has
      not  been  in  operation  for sixty consecutive days, provided that such
      failure to operate shall not have been  caused  by  strike,  riot,  war,
      public  catastrophe  or  other  act  beyond the control of the licensee.
    
      Where the commission finds that a  particular  base  station  cannot  be
      operated due to an act beyond the control of the licensee, a replacement
      base  station  license  shall  be  issued  to  the  same licensee for an
      alternative  location,  provided  that  all  other requirements for such
      license are met and provided further that  the  unexpired  term  of  the
      original license is six months or more.

      not operating pursuant to a current, valid authorization or operating as
      a commuter van without a  commuter  van  license  as  required  by  this
      chapter.  All  passengers  in  any  seized  vehicle  shall be left in or

        c.  A hearing to adjudicate the violation underlying the seizure shall
      be held before the commission  or  an  administrative  tribunal  thereof
      within  five business days after the date of the seizure. The commission
      or an administrative tribunal thereof shall, within one business day  of
      the  conclusion of the hearing, render a determination as to whether the
      vehicle has been operated by or on behalf of a person  who  is  not  the
      holder  of a current, valid authorization or has been operated without a
      commuter van vehicle license required by this chapter.
        d. An owner shall be eligible to obtain release of the  vehicle  prior
      to such hearing if such owner has not previously been found liable in an
      administrative  or  judicial  proceeding  for  operating  a vehicle as a
      commuter van service without a current, valid authorization or operating
      a commuter van without a  commuter  van  license  as  required  by  this
      chapter,  which  violation was committed within a five year period prior
      to the violation resulting in the seizure. The vehicle shall be released
      to an eligible owner upon the posting of a bond in a  form  satisfactory
      to  the  commission in an amount that shall not exceed the maximum civil
      penalties which may be imposed for the violation underlying the  seizure
      and all reasonable costs for removal and storage of such vehicle.
        e.  Where  the commission or an administrative tribunal thereof, after
      adjudication of the violation underlying the seizure,  shall  find  that
      the  vehicle  has  been  operated as a commuter van by or on behalf of a
      person who is not the  holder  of  a  current,  valid  authorization  or
      operated as a commuter van without a commuter van license:
        (1)  if  the  vehicle is not subject to forfeiture pursuant to section
      19-529.3 of this chapter, the commission shall release such  vehicle  to
      an  owner  upon  payment  of  the  applicable  civil  penalties  and all
      reasonable removal and storage costs; or
        (2) if the vehicle  is  subject  to  forfeiture  pursuant  to  section
      19-529.3  of this chapter, the commission may release such vehicle to an
      owner upon payment of the applicable civil penalties and all  reasonable
      removal  and storage costs, or may commence a forfeiture action pursuant
      to section 19-529.3 of this chapter within ten days  after  the  owner's
      written demand for such vehicle.
        f.  Where  the commission or an administrative tribunal thereof, after
      adjudication of the violation underlying the  seizure,  finds  that  the
      charge of operating without an authorization or commuter van license has
      not been sustained, the vehicle shall be released to the owner.
        If  an owner or representative of such owner has not sought to reclaim
      a seized vehicle within thirty days after  mailing  of  notice  to  such
      owner of the final adjudication by the commission or such administrative
    
      tribunal  of the violation underlying the seizure, such vehicle shall be
      deemed by the commission to be abandoned. Such vehicle shall be disposed
      of by the city pursuant to section twelve  hundred  twenty-four  of  the
      vehicle  and  traffic  law;  provided, however, that notwithstanding any
      inconsistent provision of section twelve  hundred  twenty-four  of  such
      law,  if  an  owner  seeks  to  reclaim such vehicle pursuant to section
      twelve hundred twenty-four of such law, such owner shall  be  deemed  to
      have  made  a  written  demand for such vehicle and the commission shall
      take such action as may be authorized by subdivision  e  or  f  of  this
      section.

      court proceeding for operating a  commuter  van  or  other  such  common
      carrier  by or on behalf of a person who is not the holder of a current,
      valid authorization or operating a commuter van without a  commuter  van
      license  as  required  by  this  chapter,  both of which violations were
      committed within a five-year period.
        b. A forfeiture action which is commenced  pursuant  to  this  section
      shall  be  commenced by filing of a summons with notice or a summons and
      complaint pursuant to the New York civil practice  law  and  rules,  and
      such  summons  with  notice  or  summons  and  complaint shall be served
      pursuant to subdivision c of  this  section.  A  vehicle  which  is  the
      subject  of  such  an  action  shall  remain  in the custody of the city
      pending the final determination of the forfeiture action.
        c. Service of a summons with notice or a summons and  complaint  shall
      be made:
        (1)  by  personal  service pursuant to the New York civil practice law
      and rules  upon  all  owners  of  the  vehicle  listed  in  the  records
      maintained  by  the  New York state department of motor vehicles, or for
      vehicles not registered in New York state, in the records maintained  by
      the state of registration;
        (2)  by  first  class  mail upon all individuals who have notified the
      commission or an administrative tribunal thereof that they are an  owner
      of the vehicle; and
        (3)  by  first class mail upon all persons holding a security interest
      in such vehicle which security interest has been filed with the New York
      state department of motor vehicles pursuant to the provisions  of  title
      ten  of  the  New York state vehicle and traffic law, at the address set
      forth in the records of the New York state department of motor vehicles,
      or, for vehicles not registered in New York state, all persons holding a
      security interest in such vehicle which security interest has been filed
      with such state of registration at the address provided by such state of
      registration.
        d. Any owner who receives notice of the institution  of  a  forfeiture
      action who claims an interest in the vehicle subject to forfeiture shall
      assert  a  claim  for the recovery of the vehicle or satisfaction of the
      owner's interest in such vehicle by intervening in the forfeiture action
      in accordance with the New York civil practice law and rules. Any person
      with a security interest in such vehicle  who  receives  notice  of  the
      institution  of  the  forfeiture  action  who claims an interest in such
      vehicle subject to forfeiture shall assert a claim for  satisfaction  of
      such  person's  security  interest in such vehicle by intervening in the
      forfeiture action in accordance with the New York civil practice law and
      rules.
        e. No vehicle shall be forfeited pursuant  to  this  section,  to  the
      extent  of  the  interest  of  a  person  who  claims an interest in the
      vehicle, if such person shall plead and prove as an affirmative  defense
      that:
        (1)  the use of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for the
      seizure occurred without the knowledge  of  such  person,  or,  if  such
      person  had  knowledge  of such use, without the consent of such person,
    
      and that such person did not  knowingly  obtain  such  interest  in  the
      vehicle in order to avoid the forfeiture of such vehicle; or
        (2)  the  conduct  that was the basis for the seizure was committed by
      any person other than such person claiming an interest in  the  vehicle,
      while  such  vehicle  was  unlawfully  in the possession of a person who
      acquired possession thereof in violation of the  criminal  laws  of  the
      United States or any state.
        f.  For  purposes  of  subdivision  e  of this section, if such person
      claiming an interest in the vehicle had knowledge  of  the  use  of  the
      vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for such seizure, such person
      shall  be  deemed  to have consented to the unlawful conduct unless such
      person establishes that he or she did all  that  could  reasonably  have
      been done to prevent the use of the vehicle for such unlawful conduct.
        g. The city, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, at its
      discretion, either:
        (1) retain such vehicle for the official use of the city; or
        (2)  by  public  notice  of  at least twenty days, sell such forfeited
      vehicle at public sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be  paid
      into the general fund of the city.
        h.  At  any  time  within  six months after the forfeiture, any person
      claiming an interest in a vehicle which has been forfeited  pursuant  to
      this  section  who  was  not  sent  notice  of  the  commencement of the
      forfeiture action pursuant to subdivision b or c of this section or  who
      did  not  otherwise  receive  actual notice of the forfeiture action may
      assert, in an action commenced before the justice of the  supreme  court
      before  whom  the  forfeiture  action was held, such claim as could have
      been asserted in such forfeiture action pursuant to  this  section.  The
      court  may  grant the relief sought upon such terms and conditions as it
      deems reasonable and just if such person claiming  an  interest  in  the
      vehicle  establishes  that  he  or  she  was  not  sent  notice  of  the
      commencement of the forfeiture action and was without  actual  knowledge
      of  the  forfeiture  action  and  establishes  either of the affirmative
      defenses set forth in subdivision e of this section.
        i. In any action commenced pursuant to subdivision  b  or  h  of  this
      section, where the court awards a sum of money to one or more persons in
      satisfaction  of  such person's or persons' interest or interests in the
      forfeited vehicle, the total amount awarded to satisfy such interest  or
      interests shall not exceed the amount of the net proceeds of the sale of
      the  forfeited  vehicle, after deduction of the lawful expenses incurred
      by the city, including the reasonable costs of removal  and  storage  of
      the vehicle between the time of seizure and the date of sale.

      proprietorship by the proprietor;  on  behalf  of  a  partnership  by  a
      general  partner  thereof;  on  behalf of a corporation by an officer or

        e. Before such license is issued, an applicant shall deposit with  the
      commission  a  bond,  the amount of which shall be determined by rule of
      the commission, containing one or more sureties to be  approved  by  the
      commission.  Such  bond  shall  be  payable  to  the  city  and shall be

      penalties imposed pursuant to subdivision f of this section; and payment
      of  all  judgments or settlements arising from damages occasioned to any
      person by reason of any  misrepresentation,  fraud  or  deceit,  or  any
      unlawful  act  or  omission  of  such  licensee or an employee, officer,
      director, partner, owner of more than ten  percent  of  the  outstanding
      stock  of  the  licensee or the chief executive officer of such licensee
      while such individual is acting on behalf of such licensee, or any other
      violation of this section.
        f. The commission may deny an application for a license or renewal  of
      a  license  or,  after notice and hearing, revoke or suspend any license
      issued pursuant to this section,  and/or  impose  a  civil  penalty  not
      exceeding  ten  thousand  dollars  on  a  licensee,  if it finds that an
      applicant, a licensee, any officer, director, partner, or owner of  more
      than  ten  percent of the outstanding stock of an applicant or licensee,
      or the chief executive officer of an applicant or licensee has: (1) made

      misrepresentation or omission or committed a fraudulent or unlawful  act
      while  engaged  in  the  business  or occupation of, or holding himself,
      herself or itself out as an agent. Such acts shall include  but  not  be
      limited  to:  (i)  presentation  of  a  vehicle  for  inspection  by the
      commission with a vehicle identification number other than the one under
      which such vehicle is licensed by the commission; (ii)  operation  of  a
      vehicle  with a vehicle identification number which has been removed and
      reattached, or which is other than the one under which such  vehicle  is
      licensed  by  the  commission;  (iii)  presentation of a document to the
      commission which falsely states that insurance requirements with respect
    
      to a licensed vehicle have been met; and (iv) conviction of  bribing  or
      attempting  to  bribe  any officer or employee of the commission; or (3)
      violated any provision of this section or any  applicable  rule  of  the
      commission.
        g.  Prior to the issuance of any license pursuant to this section, the
      applicant shall be fingerprinted by a person designated for such purpose
      by the chairperson and pay a fee to be submitted by the  chairperson  to
      the  state  division  of  criminal  justice services for the purposes of
      obtaining criminal history records. For purposes of securing  a  license
      pursuant  to this section, fingerprints shall be taken of the proprietor
      if the applicant is a sole proprietorship; all the general  partners  if
      the  applicant is a partnership; all the officers, directors, and owners

      organizational title.
        h.  An  application  for  a  license  required  by this section or the
      renewal thereof may be denied where the proprietor, any general partner,
      officer, director or any owner of ten percent or more of the outstanding
      stock of the applicant or the chief executive of  the  applicant  as  is
      appropriate,   has  been  convicted  of  a  crime  which  under  article
      twenty-three-A of the correction law  would  provide  a  basis  for  the
      denial of such license or renewal.
        i.  An agent licensed pursuant to this section shall be subject to all
      applicable rules of the commission.
        j. Agents licensed pursuant to this section shall promptly respond  to
      and   comply   with  all  inquiries,  directives,  summonses  and  other
      communications from the commission or from the New York city  department
      of  investigation,  and shall make their business premises and books and
      records available upon request for inspection by employees or  designees
      of the commission.
        k.  Any  agent  acting  on  behalf of an owner who leases or otherwise
      dispatches one or more taxicabs for return at the end of a  shift  shall
      maintain business premises in a location zoned for the operation of such
      business with:
        (i)  sufficient  off-street  space at or near its business premises to
      store the lesser of 25 vehicles or the following: fifty percent  of  the
      taxicabs  leased  on  a  daily  or shift basis, plus five percent of the
      taxicabs leased for longer than one day;
        (ii) sufficient office space to conduct business,  where  all  records
      required by the commission, including trip sheets and driver records are
      kept;
        (iii) regular business hours, including the hours of 9:00 a.m. through
      5:00 p.m. on every weekday other than legal holidays; and
        (iv)  a  business  address  and  telephone  number  on  file  with the
      commission.
        l. Nothing herein shall relieve the owner of a  taxicab  medallion  of
      responsibility  for  compliance  with any applicable provision of law or
      rule. Such owner shall be fully  responsible  for  the  operation  of  a
      vehicle bearing such medallion, including compliance with all regulatory
      requirements  applicable  to such vehicle, regardless of the appointment
      by such owner of an agent licensed pursuant to this section.

      or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 5.0  tons  or  less  of
      equivalent  carbon  dioxide  per year by the United States department of
      energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by
      the fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards.  In
      the  event  the  test  method  used  by  the United States environmental
      protection agency or its successor agency for determining  fuel  economy
      is  adjusted in a way that impacts United States department of energy or
      its successor agency estimates of equivalent  carbon  dioxide  emissions
      for  motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that fall within
      the affected model years, modify by rule the equivalent  carbon  dioxide
      emissions  estimate  included herein so as to appropriately reflect such
      adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section.
        b. No later than one hundred eighty days after the effective  date  of
      this  section,  the  commission  shall  develop  and  approve  a plan to
      significantly increase the number of clean air and  accessible  vehicles
      in New York city. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to:
        (1)  a description of specific measures the commission will implement,
      or recommend to the mayor and the  council  for  implementation  through
      local  law,  to increase the number of clean air and accessible vehicles
      and periodic goals for achieving such increases;
        (2)  a  schedule,  including  interim  and   final   milestones,   for
      implementing such measures; and
        (3)  an education campaign regarding clean air and accessible vehicles
      that provides taxicab and for-hire vehicle owners and prospective owners
      with information regarding the  availability,  costs  and  savings,  and
      benefits of such vehicles for such owners. Such information may include,
      but  is  not limited to: (i) for available clean air vehicle models: the
      fuel economy of such vehicles, as compared with other  models  typically
      used  as  taxicabs  and  for-hire  vehicles  in New York city; costs and
      savings associated with the purchase  and  use  of  such  vehicles;  the
      estimated air quality benefits associated with the use of such vehicles;
      and  any  available  governmental  and  manufacturer  incentives for the
      purchase of such vehicles; and (ii)  for  available  accessible  vehicle
      models:  the  fact  that  such  vehicles  can  be used to serve specific
      clients that non-accessible vehicles cannot  serve;  costs  and  savings
      associated  with  the  purchase  of  such  vehicles;  and  any available
      governmental and  manufacturer  incentives  for  the  purchase  of  such
      vehicles.  Such  information shall be posted on the commission's website
      and shall be provided to owners of taxicabs and for-hire  vehicles  upon
      issuance  or  renewal  of a license in accordance with section 19-504 of
      this chapter; by sending such information directly to such  owners  with
      other  commission  documents and notices; during informational workshops
      open to  all  commission  licensees;  or  in  any  other  manner  deemed
      appropriate by the commission.
        c.  The  commission  shall  implement  the plan developed and approved
      pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
    
        d. The commission  shall  conduct  or  participate  in  at  least  one
      informational  workshop  regarding  clean air and accessible vehicles in
      each of the two calendar years following the development and approval of
      the plan pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
        e.  The  commission shall in every annual report submitted to the city
      council pursuant to section twenty three hundred two  of  the  New  York
      city  charter, include the following information: (i) the implementation
      status of the measures included  in  the  plan  developed  and  approved
      pursuant  to  this section; (ii) the numbers of clean air and accessible
      vehicles in New York city, disaggregated by vehicle model, and how  such
      numbers  compare  to  those  of the previous year and with the goals set
      forth in such plan; and (iii) to the extent practicable,  the  estimated
      air  quality  benefits  and fuel savings associated with the use of each
      clean air vehicle model in operation as a taxicab or for-hire vehicle in
      New York city and the aggregate air quality benefits  and  fuel  savings
      associated with the use of all such vehicles.
        f.  The  commission  shall establish a web page or pages or modify its
      existing website to make available information regarding clean  air  and
      accessible  vehicles,  which  shall  include, but not be limited to, the
      information provided pursuant to paragraph three  of  subdivision  b  of
      this section and the numbers of clean air and accessible vehicles in New
      York  city, disaggregated by vehicle model, which shall be updated, at a
      minimum, every four months.
        g. The commission shall  annually  review  the  plan  required  to  be
      implemented  pursuant  to  subdivision  c  of this section to determine,
      among other things, whether such plan has helped to increase the  number
      of  clean  air  and accessible vehicles and whether scheduled milestones
      and goals included in such plan have  been  met.  The  commission  shall
      revise such plan as necessary to accomplish such goals.

Section 19-535 ::    
        
     
        § 19-535 Extension of retirement periods for taxicabs. a. Definitions.
      For  the  purposes  of this section only, the following terms shall have
      the following meanings:
        1. "Accessible taxicab" shall mean any vehicle approved for use by the
      commission as a taxicab that meets the specifications  and  requirements
      for  accessible vehicles pursuant to the americans with disabilities act
      of 1990, as amended, and rules promulgated by the commission.
        2. "Level one clean air taxicab" shall mean any vehicle  approved  for
      use  by the commission as a taxicab that receives an air pollution score
      of 9.5 or higher from the United States environmental protection  agency
      or  its  successor  agency  and is estimated to emit 5.0 tons or less of
      equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United  States  department  of
      energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by
      the  fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards. In
      the event the test  method  used  by  the  United  States  environmental
      protection  agency  or its successor agency for determining fuel economy
      is adjusted in a way that impacts United States department of energy  or
      its  successor  agency  estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions
      for motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that fall  within
      the  affected  model years, modify by rule the equivalent carbon dioxide
      emissions estimate included herein so as to appropriately  reflect  such
      adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section.
        3.  "Level  two  clean air taxicab" shall mean any vehicle approved by
      the commission for use as a taxicab that receives an air pollution score
      of 9.0 or higher from the United States environmental protection  agency
      or  its  successor  agency  and is estimated to emit 6.4 tons or less of
      equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United  States  department  of
      energy  or its successor agency and that does not meet the definition of
      a  level  one  clean  air  taxicab  pursuant  to  paragraph  2  of  this
      subdivision; provided that such vehicle is powered by the fuel for which
      such  vehicle meets the above-specified standards. In the event the test
      method used by the United States environmental protection agency or  its
      successor  agency for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way that
      impacts United States department  of  energy  or  its  successor  agency
      estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles, the
      commission  shall,  for  vehicles  that  fall  within the affected model
      years, modify by rule the equivalent carbon dioxide  emissions  estimate
      included  herein so as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact
      consistent with the intent of this section.
        b. Extension of retirement period. 1. The retirement  period  for  any
      accessible  taxicab  or level one clean air taxicab shall be extended by
      two years beyond the applicable standard retirement period for  taxicabs
      established  pursuant  to  rule  of  the  commission;  provided that the
      retirement period for any such taxicab that must be retired and replaced
      pursuant to rules of the commission  no  later  than  thirty-six  months
      after the vehicle is hacked up, shall be extended by one year beyond the
      applicable  standard retirement period for taxicabs established pursuant
      to rule of the commission. The  two-year  extension  period  established
      pursuant to this paragraph shall also apply to any vehicle, as specified
      by rule of the commission, which is not a level one clean air taxicab as
      defined  in  this  section,  but  which  meets  or exceeds the standards
      established pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision a of this section.
        2. The retirement period for any level two clean air taxicab shall  be
      extended  by  one  year beyond the applicable standard retirement period
      for taxicabs established pursuant to rule of the commission.
        3.  The  commission  may  modify  the   extended   retirement   period
      established  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  for any taxicab where such
      vehicle  does  not  pass  two  of   the   inspections,   not   including
    
      reinspections,   conducted   at  the  commission's  inspection  facility
      pursuant to section 19-504 of this chapter in  the  twelve-month  period
      immediately  preceding the time at which such vehicle would otherwise be
      required to be retired pursuant to rule of the commission, or where such
      vehicle  does  not  pass  an  inspection  conducted  at the commission's
      inspection facility pursuant to section 19-504 of this chapter after the
      time at which such vehicle would otherwise be  required  to  be  retired
      pursuant to rule of the commission.
        c.  Nothing  contained  herein  shall  affect  the  authority  of  the
      commission pursuant to subdivision f of section 19-504 of  this  chapter
      to  order  an  owner  to  repair  or replace a licensed vehicle where it
      appears that such vehicle no longer meets the reasonable  standards  for
      safe operation prescribed by the commission.

        §  19-536  Clean  air  vehicle  labeling  and  information. a. For the
      purposes of this section, the term "clean air vehicle"  shall  mean  any
      taxicab  approved  for  use  by  the  commission  that  receives  an air
      pollution score of 9.0 or higher from the  United  States  environmental
      protection  agency  or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 6.4
      tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United  States
      department of energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle
      is  powered by the fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified
      standards. In the event the  test  method  used  by  the  United  States
      environmental  protection agency or its successor agency for determining
      fuel economy is adjusted in a way that impacts United States  department
      of energy or its successor agency estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide
      emissions  for  motor  vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that
      fall within the affected model years,  modify  by  rule  the  equivalent
      carbon dioxide emissions estimate included herein so as to appropriately
      reflect  such  adjustment's  impact  consistent  with the intent of this
      section.
        b. The commission shall develop and provide information to each  owner
      of  a  clean  air  vehicle, which shall be made available for viewing in
      each such vehicle in a manner that is clearly apparent  to  a  passenger
      located  in the back seat of such vehicle, and which (i) identifies such
      vehicle as a clean  air  vehicle;  (ii)  includes  the  address  of  the
      commission  web  page(s)  required to be established pursuant to section
      19-534 of this chapter; and (iii) includes, to the  extent  practicable,
      the  estimated  air  quality  benefits  associated  with the use of such
      vehicle and the type of fuel used to power such vehicle.
