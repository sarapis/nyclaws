      which could be a basis for license revocation or suspension.
        3. (a) (i) On and after July thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-three,
      no  new  temporary  permits  shall  be  issued  until the number of such
      permits which are in effect is less than one thousand.  Thereafter,  the
      maximum  number  of  such  permits  which  may be in effect shall be one
      thousand and no new permits shall be issued in excess  of  such  maximum
      number. Notwithstanding the limitations on the issuance of new temporary
      permits,  a  temporary  permit  issued prior to July thirtieth, nineteen
      hundred eighty-three shall be renewable by  the  licensee  to  whom  the
      permit  was issued within one year of its expiration date subject to the
      provisions of clause (ii) of this subparagraph  and  provided  that  all
      other  requirements  for renewal under the provisions of this subchapter
      and any rules  promulgated  pursuant  thereto  are  complied  with,  the
      license  of  the  person to whom the permit was issued or the permit has
      not been revoked or suspended and  the  licensee  has  not  committed  a
      violation  or  violations  which  could be a basis for license or permit
      revocation or suspension.

      and  after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six, and on every
      renewal date thereafter, a permit holder may not  renew  more  than  one
      permit,  whether  full-term  or  temporary. Such permit shall be renewed
      provided that all other requirements for renewal under the provisions of
      this subchapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto are  complied
      with,  the  license  of  the person to whom the permit was issued or the
      permit has not been  revoked  or  suspended  and  such  person  has  not
      committed a violation or violations which could be a basis for permit or
      license suspension or revocation.
        (B)(I)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, on
      and after the effective date of the local law which added this  subitem,
      any  person  who is an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer of a food
      product and who on February third, nineteen hundred ninety-five  was  an
    
      exclusive  distributor  or  a manufacturer of such food product who held
      more than one temporary permit issued pursuant to this  subchapter,  may
      be issued the number of additional temporary permits such person held on
      February  third,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  and,  in addition, may
      continue to hold one full-term permit issued pursuant to this subchapter
      if such exclusive distributor or manufacturer held one full-term  permit
      issued  pursuant  to  this subchapter on the effective date of the local
      law  which  added  this  subitem.  A  written  agreement  evidencing  an
      exclusive  distributorship shall be proof satisfactory that an applicant
      for multiple temporary permits was an exclusive distributor  of  a  food
      product  on  February  third,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  and is an
      exclusive  distributor  of  such  food  product  at  the  time  of  such
      application.  Any  written agreement evidencing an applicant's status as
      an exclusive distributor on February third, nineteen hundred ninety-five
      shall have been in effect on such date.
        (II) Any person  who  is  eligible  for  the  issuance  of  additional
      temporary permits pursuant to subitem (I) of this item shall be issued a
      maximum of sixty temporary permits.
        (III) Additional temporary permits shall be issued pursuant to subitem

      permit  issued  pursuant to this subchapter revoked or suspended and who
      satisfy the commissioner that they are fit and able to conduct, maintain
      and operate a food vending  business.  Such  permits  shall  be  renewed
      provided that all other requirements for renewal under the provisions of
      this  subchapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto are complied
      with, the license of the person to whom the permits were issued  or  the
      permits  have  not  been  revoked  or  suspended and such person has not
      committed a violation or violations which would be a basis for permit or
      license suspension or revocation.
        (IV) Nothing contained in subitem (I) of this item shall be  construed
      as  authorizing the issuance of full-term or temporary permits in excess
      of the numbers of such permits that are authorized to be issued pursuant
      to paragraph two of subdivision b of this section or clause (i) of  this
      subparagraph.
        (b)   On  and  after  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five,

      temporary  permit  revoked or suspended and who satisfy the commissioner
      that they are fit and able  to  conduct,  maintain  or  operate  a  food
      vending business.
        (c)  The  issuance  or  renewal of a temporary permit pursuant to this
      subchapter shall be subject to the permittee within three  months  after
      the  certification  of  a  complete  application  therefor  presenting a
      pushcart or vehicle for inspection by  the  department  and  within  six
      months after such certification, passing such inspection.

      issuance  of  temporary  permits  pursuant  to  this  subchapter  to  be
      administered in accordance with procedures to be established by rules of
      the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  may  by  rule limit the number of
      places on such waiting list.
        (e) Temporary permits and temporary licenses issued pursuant  to  this
      subchapter  shall  be  valid only during the period of time beginning on

      or manufacturer's temporary permit attached thereto to a person licensed
      as a food vendor pursuant to  this  subchapter  if  (a)  such  exclusive
      distributor  or  manufacturer files with the department the bill of sale
      or other proof of ownership for such vehicle or  pushcart  with  a  duly
      issued sales tax receipt attached thereto; (b) such lease agreement sets
      forth the food product which may be primarily sold using such vehicle or
      pushcart;  and  (c)  such lease agreement is approved by the department,
      provided, however, that if such  lease  agreement  is  not  approved  or
      disapproved  within  thirty  calendar days after such lease agreement is
      filed with the department, such lease agreement shall be  deemed  to  be
      approved  by  the  department.  The  commissioner shall promulgate rules
      establishing the standards by which the department shall  evaluate  such
      lease  agreements  and  such standards shall include, but not be limited
      to, requirements that such lease agreements contain fair and  reasonable
      terms  based upon such factors as the cost of purchasing and maintaining
      such pushcart or vehicle and that the terms of such lease agreement  are
      the  result  of an arm's length negotiation between the parties thereto.
      Subleasing of any such vehicle  or  pushcart  owned  by  such  exclusive
      distributor   or  manufacturer  with  such  exclusive  distributor's  or
      manufacturer's temporary permit attached thereto is strictly prohibited.
      Authorized officers and employees of the department  of  small  business
      services and the department of investigation may assist the commissioner
      and the department in effectuating the provisions of this paragraph. Any
      violation or violations of the provisions of this paragraph or any rules
      promulgated  hereunder by an exclusive distributor or a manufacturer who
      has been issued more than one temporary permit pursuant to item  (B)  of
      clause  (ii)  of subparagraph (a) of paragraph three of subdivision f of
      section 17-307 of this subchapter may be the  basis  for  suspension  or
    
      revocation of all of the permits issued to such exclusive distributor or
      manufacturer pursuant to this subchapter.

      permit in accordance with this subchapter.
        j.  Where  exigent  circumstances  exist and a police officer or other
      authorized officer or employee of the city gives notice to a food vendor

      or  a  permit to vend food from a vehicle or pushcart in a public place,
      and may, after due notice and an opportunity to be heard, in addition to
      any other penalties provided herein, refuse to renew, suspend or  revoke

      or of the New  York  city  health  code,  or  the  applicant,  licensee,
      permittee,  its  officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers or
      employees have pending any unanswered summonses for  violation  of  this
      subchapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto.

      to  this  subchapter  for  a  period  of  up to ten days. Notice of such
      suspension  shall  be  served  on  the  licensee   or   permittee.   The
      commissioner   shall   provide   the  licensee  or  permittee  with  the
      opportunity for a hearing within ten  days  after  the  notification  of
      suspension,   after  which  the  commissioner  shall  forthwith  make  a
      determination as to whether such  suspension  should  continue  and  the
      length  of  such  suspension,  and in addition may impose any penalty or
      sanction authorized by this subchapter or any rules promulgated pursuant

      where there has been the addition of any member or  where  such  limited
      liability  company  has  been  dissolved,  and  where the permittee is a
      partnership, where there has been the addition of any partner  or  where
      such partnership has been dissolved.
        e.  Each applicant, licensee and permittee shall notify the department

      vending   business   and  a  conviction  of  such  applicant,  licensee,
      permittee, its officers, directors, shareholders, members,  managers  or
      employees  for  any  offense  occurring  after  the  filing  date of the
      application for a license or permit or a renewal  thereof  or  occurring
