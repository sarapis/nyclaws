      date of such letter. Such letter shall state that such veterinarian will
      cause such dog or cat to be sterilized at the request of  such  consumer
      on  or  before  such  later specified date. Such veterinarian shall also
      provide to the pet shop a  certificate,  in  such  form  and  manner  as
      determined  by  rules promulgated by the department, stating the date on
      which such sterilization was performed. Any consumer who provides a  pet

      request of employees or authorized  agents  of  the  department,  owners
      shall  provide  proof  satisfactory  to  the department that a cat found

      on the ground that the cat has not been sterilized.
        e. The department shall post and maintain on its website  a  regularly
      updated   list   of   organizations   in   New   York  city  that  offer

      population  control  program  established  pursuant to section 17-811 of
      this chapter and section three-a of chapter one hundred fifteen  of  the
      laws  of  eighteen hundred ninety-four, and all other moneys credited or

        § 17-813 Dog license fee. a. In addition to the fees required pursuant
      to  chapter 115 of the laws of 1894, as amended, any person applying for
      a dog license shall pay twenty-five dollars and fifty cents for any  dog
      four  months of age or older that has not been spayed or neutered unless
      an owner presents with the license application a statement certified  by
      a  licensed veterinarian stating that he or she has examined the dog and
      found that because of old age or other reasons,  the  life  of  the  dog
      would be endangered by spaying or neutering.
