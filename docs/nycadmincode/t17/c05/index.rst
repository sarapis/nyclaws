      respect to the place of employment.
        f.  Employers  shall  prominently  post  the  smoking  policy  in  the

      prohibited or restricted pursuant to section 17-503, and is  not  exempt
      from regulation under section 17-505, smoking shall be prohibited.
        j.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair, diminish, or
      otherwise  affect  any  collectively  bargained  procedure   or   remedy
      available  to an employee, existing as of February 1, 1995, with respect
      to disputes arising under the employer's smoking policy or with  respect
      to the establishment of a procedure for redress of any adverse personnel
      action  taken  against  an  employee  in retaliation for that employee's
      attempt to exercise his or her rights under this chapter with respect to
    
      the place of  employment.  Upon  expiration  of  any  such  collectively
      bargained procedure or remedy, the provisions of this section shall take

      restricted pursuant to this chapter, or the designated agent thereof, to
      (i) provide a room designated for smoking including, but not limited to,
      a separate smoking room or an enclosed room, which fails to comply  with
      the  provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that the obligations
      of an owner or building manager of  a  building  (where  such  owner  or
      building manager of a building in which a public place is located is not
      the  operator  or  employer of such public place) with respect to such a
      room shall be limited to work authorized by  any  permits  necessary  to

      relevant time period actual control of the premises was not exercised by
      the respondent or a person under the  control  of  the  respondent,  but
      rather  by  a  lessee, sublessee or any other person; provided, however,
      that after receiving the notice of violation, the respondent submits  to
      the  department  within  five  business days, by certified mail, a sworn
      affidavit and other such proof as may be necessary, indicating  that  he
      or she has not exercised actual control during the relevant time period;
      (ii)  that  a  person  smoking  in  any area where smoking is prohibited
      pursuant to section 17-503 was informed by a person who  owns,  manages,
      operates  or  otherwise  controls  the  use  of  such  premises,  or the
      designated agent thereof, that such person smoking is  in  violation  of
      this  local  law  and  that  such  person who owns, manages, operates or
      otherwise controls the use  of  such  premises  has  complied  with  all
      applicable  provisions  of this chapter during the relevant time period;
      provided,  however,  that  after  receiving  notice  of  violation,  the
      respondent  submits  to  the  department  within  five business days, by
      certified mail, a sworn  affidavit  and  other  such  proof  as  may  be
      necessary, indicating that respondent informed the person smoking in any
      area  where  smoking  is prohibited pursuant to section 17-503 that such
      person was in violation of  this  local  law  and  that  respondent  has
      complied  with  all  applicable  provisions  of  this chapter during the
      relevant time period; or (iii) that a person smoking in  any  restricted
      common  indoor  area  where  smoking  is  prohibited pursuant to section
      17-503 was not informed by the owner or building manager of the premises
      (where such owner or building manager of a building in  which  a  public
      place  or  a  place  of  employment  is  located  is not the operator or
      employer of such public place or place of employment) or by the operator
      of a multiple dwelling containing ten or more dwelling units  that  such
      person  smoking  is  in  violation of this local law because such owner,
      building manager or operator did not have a  designated  agent  on  duty
      when  such  person  was  smoking and that such owner or building manager
      has, where applicable, complied with the mailing of  a  notice  required
      pursuant  to  subdivision  e  of section 17-507; provided, however, that
      after receiving notice of  violation,  the  respondent  submits  to  the
      department  within  five  business  days,  by  certified  mail,  a sworn
      affidavit and other such proof as may be necessary,  indicating  that  a
      person  smoking  in  any  restricted common indoor area where smoking is
      prohibited pursuant to section 17-503 was not informed by the respondent
      that such person smoking is in violation of this local law  because  the
      respondent  did not have a designated agent on duty when such person was
    
      smoking and that the respondent has, where applicable, mailed the notice
      required pursuant to subdivision e of section 17-507.
        b.  It  shall be unlawful for an employer whose place of employment is
      subject to regulation under section 17-504 to fail to  comply  with  the
      provisions  of  that  section,  including,  but  not  limited  to, those
      provisions requiring the  adoption,  implementation,  dissemination  and
      maintenance   of   a  written  smoking  policy  which  conforms  to  the
      requirements of subdivision e of section 17-504, or to fail  to  make  a
      good  faith  effort  to  comply with subdivision c of section 17-507. In
      actions brought for violations of  this  subdivision,  it  shall  be  an
      affirmative defense that the employer (i) has made good faith efforts to
      insure that employees comply with the provisions of such written smoking
      policy  and  (ii)  has  complied  with all applicable provisions of this
      chapter.

      twelve  months,  be  liable  for  a  civil penalty of not less than five
      hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars; and for a  third  or
      subsequent  violation,  all  of  which were committed within a period of
